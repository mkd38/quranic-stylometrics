    <body><ayah num="1"/> Glory to (Allah) Who did take His servant for a Journey by night from the
        Sacred Mosque to the farthest Mosque, whose precincts We did bless,- in order that We might
        show him some of Our Signs: for He is the One Who heareth and seeth (all things). <ayah
            num="2"/>
        <device technique="allusion">We gave Moses the Book, and made it a Guide to the Children of
            Israel, (commanding): "Take not other than Me as Disposer of (your) affairs."</device>
        <ayah num="3"/>
        <device technique="allusion">O ye that are sprung from those whom We carried (in the Ark)
            with Noah! Verily he was a devotee most grateful.</device>
        <ayah num="4"/> And We gave (Clear) Warning to the Children of Israel in the Book, that
            <device technique="anaphora">twice would they</device> do mischief on the earth and be
        elated with mighty arrogance (and <device technique="anaphora">twice would they</device> be
        punished)! <ayah num="5"/> When the first of the warnings came to pass, We sent against you
        Our servants given to terrible warfare: They entered the very inmost parts of your homes;
        and it was a warning (completely) fulfilled. <ayah num="6"/> Then did We grant you the
        Return as against them: <device technique="parallelism">We gave you increase in resources
            and sons, and made you the more numerous in man-power.</device>
        <ayah num="7"/> If <device technique="anaphora">ye did</device> well, <device
            technique="anaphora">ye did</device> well for yourselves; if <device
            technique="anaphora">ye did</device> evil, (<device technique="anaphora">ye did</device>
        it) against yourselves. So when the second of the warnings came to pass, (We permitted your
        enemies) <device technique="metaphor">to disfigure your faces</device>, and to <device
            technique="allusion">enter your Temple as they had entered it before</device>, and to
        visit with destruction all that fell into their power. <ayah num="8"/> It may be that your
        Lord may (yet) show Mercy unto you; <device technique="parallelism">but if ye revert (to
            your sins), We shall revert (to Our punishments):</device> And <device technique="irony"
            >we have made Hell a prison</device> for those who reject (all Faith). <ayah num="9"/>
        Verily this Qur'an doth guide to that which is most right (or stable), and giveth the Glad
        Tidings to the Believers who work deeds of righteousness, that they shall have a magnificent
        reward; <ayah num="10"/> And to those who believe not in the Hereafter, (it announceth) that
        We have prepared for them a Penalty Grievous (indeed). <ayah num="11"/>
        <device technique="irony">The prayer that man should make for good, he maketh for
            evil;</device> for man is given to hasty (deeds). <ayah num="12"/> We have made the
        Night and the Day as two (of Our) Signs: <device technique="parallelism">the Sign of the
            Night have We obscured, while the Sign of the Day We have made to enlighten
            you;</device>
        <device technique="anaphora">that ye may</device> seek bounty from your Lord, and <device
            technique="anaphora">that ye may</device> know the number and count of the years: all
        things have We explained in detail. <ayah num="13"/>
        <device technique="metaphor">Every man's fate We have fastened on his own neck:</device> On
        the Day of Judgment We shall bring out for him a scroll, which he will see spread open.
            <ayah num="14"/> (It will be said to him:) "Read thine (own) record: Sufficient is thy
        soul this day to make out an account against thee." <ayah num="15"/>
        <device technique="parallelism">Who receiveth guidance, receiveth it for his own
            benefit</device>: who goeth astray doth so to his own loss: No bearer of burdens can
        bear the burden of another: nor would We visit with Our Wrath until We had sent an messenger
        (to give warning). <ayah num="16"/> When We decide to destroy a population, We (first) send
        a definite order to those among them who are given the good things of this life and yet
        transgress; so that the word is proved true against them: then (it is) We destroy them
        utterly. <ayah num="17"/>
        <device technique="rhetoricalQuestion">How many generations have We destroyed after
            Noah?</device> and enough is thy Lord to note and see the sins of His servants. <ayah
            num="18"/>
        <device technique="irony">If any do wish for the transitory things (of this life), We
            readily grant them - <device technique="parallelism">such things as We will, to such
                person as We will</device>: in the end have We provided Hell for them: they will
            burn therein, disgraced and rejected.</device>
        <ayah num="19"/> Those who do wish for the (things of) the Hereafter, and strive therefor
        with all due striving, and have Faith,- they are the ones whose striving is acceptable (to
        Allah). <ayah num="20"/> Of the bounties of thy Lord We bestow freely on all- These as well
        as those: The bounties of thy Lord are not closed (to anyone). <ayah num="21"/>
        <device technique="contrast">See how We have bestowed more on some than on others</device>;
        but verily the Hereafter is more in rank and gradation and more in excellence. <ayah
            num="22"/> Take not with Allah another object of worship; or thou (O man!) wilt sit in
        disgrace and destitution. <ayah num="23"/> Thy Lord hath decreed that ye worship none but
        Him, and that ye be kind to parents. Whether one or both of them attain old age in thy life,
            <device technique="parallelism">say not to them a word of contempt, nor repel them, but
            address them in terms of honour.</device>
        <ayah num="24"/> And, out of kindness, <device technique="metaphor">lower to them the wing
            of humility</device>, and say: "My Lord! bestow on them thy Mercy even as they cherished
        me in childhood." <ayah num="25"/> Your Lord knoweth best what is in your hearts: If ye do
        deeds of righteousness, verily He is Most Forgiving to those who turn to Him again and again
        (in true penitence). <ayah num="26"/> And render to the kindred their due rights, as (also)
        to those in want, and to the wayfarer: But squander not (your wealth) in the manner of a
        spendthrift. <ayah num="27"/>
        <device technique="parallelism">Verily spendthrifts are brothers of the Evil Ones; and the
            Evil One is to his Lord (himself) ungrateful.</device>
        <ayah num="28"/> And even if thou hast to turn away from them in pursuit of the Mercy from
        thy Lord which thou dost expect, yet speak to them a word of easy kindness. <ayah num="29"/>
        <device technique="simile">Make not thy hand tied (like a niggard's) to thy neck, nor
            stretch it forth to its utmost reach, so that thou become blameworthy and
            destitute.</device>
        <ayah num="30"/> Verily thy Lord doth provide sustenance in abundance for whom He pleaseth,
        and He provideth in a just measure. For He doth know and regard all His servants. <ayah
            num="31"/> Kill not your children for fear of want: We shall provide sustenance for them
        as well as for you. Verily the killing of them is a great sin. <ayah num="32"/> Nor come
        nigh to adultery: for it is a shameful (deed) and an evil, opening the road (to other
        evils). <ayah num="33"/> Nor take life - which Allah has made sacred - except for just
        cause. And if anyone is slain wrongfully, we have given his heir authority (to demand qisas
        or to forgive): but let him not exceed bounds in the matter of taking life; for he is helped
        (by the Law). <ayah num="34"/> Come not nigh to the orphan's property except to improve it,
        until he attains the age of full strength; and fulfil (every) engagement, for (every)
        engagement will be enquired into (on the Day of Reckoning). <ayah num="35"/> Give full
        measure when ye measure, and weigh with a balance that is straight: that is the most fitting
        and the most advantageous in the final determination. <ayah num="36"/>
        <device technique="imagery">And pursue not that of which thou hast no knowledge; for every
            act of hearing, or of seeing or of (feeling in) the heart will be enquired into (on the
            Day of Reckoning).</device>
        <ayah num="37"/> Nor walk on the earth with insolence: for thou canst not rend the earth
        asunder, nor reach the mountains in height. <ayah num="38"/> Of all such things the evil is
        hateful in the sight of thy Lord. <ayah num="39"/> These are among the (precepts of) wisdom,
        which thy Lord has revealed to thee. Take not, with Allah, another object of worship,
            <device technique="imagery">lest thou shouldst be thrown into Hell,</device> blameworthy
        and rejected. <ayah num="40"/>
        <device technique="rhetoricalQuestion">Has then your Lord (O Pagans!) preferred for you
            sons, and taken for Himself daughters among the angels?</device> Truly ye utter a most
        dreadful saying! <ayah num="41"/>
        <device technique="irony">We have explained (things) in various (ways) in this Qur'an, in
            order that they may receive admonition, but it only increases their flight (from the
            Truth)!</device>
        <ayah num="42"/> Say: If there had been (other) gods with Him, as they say,- behold, they
        would certainly have sought out a way to the Lord of the Throne! <ayah num="43"/> Glory to
        Him! He is high above all that they say!- Exalted and Great (beyond measure)! <ayah num="44"/>
        <device technique="imagery">The seven heavens and the earth, and all beings therein, declare
            His glory:</device> there is not a thing but celebrates His praise; And yet ye
        understand not how they declare His glory! Verily He is Oft-Forbear, Most Forgiving! <ayah
            num="45"/><device technique="imagery">When thou dost recite the Qur'an, We put, between
            thee and those who believe not in the Hereafter, a veil invisible:</device>
        <ayah num="46"/> And We put coverings over their hearts (and minds) lest they should
        understand the Qur'an, and deafness into their ears: when thou dost commemorate thy Lord and
        Him alone in the Qur'an, <device technique="imagery">they turn on their backs, fleeing (from
            the Truth).</device>
        <ayah num="47"/> We know best why it is they listen, when they listen to thee; and when they
        meet in private conference, behold, the wicked say, "Ye follow none other than a man
        bewitched!" <ayah num="48"/> See what similes they strike for thee: but they have gone
        astray, and never can they find a way. <ayah num="49"/> They say: <device
            technique="rhetoricalQuestion">What! when we are <device technique="metaphor">reduced to
                bones and dust,</device> should we really be raised up (to be) a new
            creation?"</device>
        <ayah num="50"/> Say: "(Nay!) be ye stones or iron, <ayah num="51"/> "Or created matter
        which, in your minds, is hardest (to be raised up),- (Yet shall ye be raised up)!" then will
        they say: <device technique="rhetoricalQuestion">"Who will cause us to return?"</device>
        Say: "He who created you first!" Then will they wag their heads towards thee, and
            say,<device technique="rhetoricalQuestion">"When will that be?"</device> Say, "May be it
        will be quite soon! <ayah num="52"/>
        <device technique="imagery">It will be on a Day when He will call you, and ye will answer
            (His call) with (words of) His praise, and ye will think that ye tarried but a little
            while!"</device>
        <ayah num="53"/> Say to My servants that they should (only) say those things that are best:
            <device technique="anaphora">for Satan</device> doth sow dissensions among them: <device
            technique="anaphora"><device technique="allusion">For Satan</device> is to man an avowed
            enemy.</device>
        <ayah num="54"/> It is your Lord that knoweth you best: <device technique="contrast"><device
                technique="anaphora">If He please</device>, He granteth you mercy, or <device
                technique="anaphora">if He please</device>, punishment:</device> We have not sent
        thee to be a disposer of their affairs for them. <ayah num="55"/> And it is your Lord that
        knoweth best all beings that are in the heavens and on earth: We did bestow on some prophets
        more (and other) gifts than on others: <device technique="allusion">and We gave to David
            (the gift of) the Psalms.</device>
        <ayah num="56"/> Say: "Call on those - besides Him - whom ye fancy: they have neither the
        power to remove your troubles from you nor to change them." <ayah num="57"/> Those whom they
        call upon do desire (for themselves) means of access to their Lord, - even those who are
        nearest: <device technique="contrast">they hope for His Mercy and fear His Wrath:</device>
        for the Wrath of thy Lord is something to take heed of. <ayah num="58"/> There is not a
        population but We shall destroy it before the Day of Judgment or punish it with a dreadful
        Penalty: that is written in the (eternal) Record. <ayah num="59"/> And We refrain from
        sending the signs, only because the men of former generations treated them as false: We sent
        the she-camel to the Thamud to open their eyes, but they treated her wrongfully: <device
            technique="metaphor">We only send the Signs by way of terror</device> (and warning from
        evil). <ayah num="60"/> Behold! We told thee that thy Lord doth encompass mankind round
        about: We granted the vision which We showed thee, but as a trial for men,- as also the
        Cursed Tree (mentioned) in the Qur'an: We put terror (and warning) into them, but it only
        increases their inordinate transgression! <ayah num="61"/>
        <device technique="imagery">Behold! We said to the angels: "Bow down unto <device

            from clay?"</device>
        <ayah num="62"/> He said: "Seest Thou? this is the one whom Thou hast honoured above me! If
        Thou wilt but respite me to the Day of Judgment, I will surely bring his descendants under
        my sway - all but a few!" <ayah num="63"/> (Allah) said: "Go thy way; if any of them follow
        thee, verily Hell will be the recompense of you (all)- an ample recompense. <ayah num="64"/>
        "Lead to destruction those whom thou canst among them, <device technique="metaphor">with thy

        mutually share with them wealth and children; and make promises to them." But Satan promises
        them nothing but deceit. <ayah num="65"/> "As for My servants, no authority shalt thou have
        over them:" Enough is thy Lord for a Disposer of affairs. <ayah num="66"/> Your Lord is He
        That maketh the <device technique="metaphor">Ship</device> go smoothly for you through the

        <device technique="irony">When distress seizes you at sea, those that ye call upon - besides
            Himself - leave you in the lurch! but when He brings you back safe to land, ye turn away
            (from Him).</device> Most ungrateful is man! <ayah num="68"/>
        <device technique="rhetoricalQuestion">Do ye then feel secure that He will not cause you to
            be swallowed up beneath the earth when ye are on land, or that He will not send against
            you a <device technique="imagery">violent tornado (with showers of stones)</device> so
            that ye shall find no one to carry out your affairs for you?</device>

        <device technique="rhetoricalQuestion">Or do ye feel secure</device> that He will not send
        you back a second time to sea and send against you a heavy gale to drown you because of your

        honoured the sons of <device technique="allusion">Adam</device>; provided them with
        transport on land and sea; given them for sustenance things good and pure; and conferred on
        them special favours, above a great part of our creation. <ayah num="71"/> One day We shall
        call together all human beings with their (respective) Imams: those who are given their
        record in their right hand will read it (with pleasure), and they will not be dealt with
        unjustly in the least. <ayah num="72"/>
        <device technique="parallelism">But those who were <device technique="metaphor"
                >blind</device> in this world, will be <device technique="metaphor">blind</device>
            in the hereafter,</device> and most astray from the Path. <ayah num="73"/> And their
        purpose was to tempt thee away from that which We had revealed unto thee, to substitute in
        our name something quite different; (in that case), behold! they would certainly have made
        thee (their) friend! <ayah num="74"/> And had We not given thee strength, thou wouldst
        nearly have inclined to them a little. <ayah num="75"/> In that case We should have made
        thee taste <device technique="anaphora">an equal portion</device> (of punishment) in this
        life, and <device technique="anaphora">an equal portion</device> in death: and moreover thou
        wouldst have found none to help thee against Us! <ayah num="76"/> Their purpose was to scare
        thee off the land, in order to expel thee; but in that case they would not have stayed
        (therein) after thee, except for a little while. <ayah num="77"/> (This was Our) way with
        the messengers We sent before thee: thou wilt find no change in Our ways. <ayah num="78"/>
        Establish regular prayers - at the sun's decline till the darkness of the night, and the
        morning prayer and reading: for the prayer and reading in the morning carry their testimony.
            <ayah num="79"/> And pray in the small watches of the morning: (it would be) an
        additional prayer (or spiritual profit) for thee: soon will thy Lord raise thee to a Station

        <device technique="irony">Say: "If ye had control of the Treasures of the Mercy of my Lord,

        <ayah num="101"/> To Moses We did give Nine Clear Signs: As the Children of Israel: when he
        came to them, Pharaoh said to him: "O Moses! I consider thee, indeed, to have been worked
        upon by sorcery! <ayah num="102"/> Moses said, "Thou knowest well that these things have
        been sent down by none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth as eye-opening evidence:
        and I consider thee indeed, O Pharaoh, to be one doomed to destruction!" <ayah num="103"/>
        <device technique="irony"> So he resolved to remove them from the face of the earth: but We
            did drown him and all who were with him.</device>
        <ayah num="104"/> And We said thereafter to the Children of Israel, "Dwell securely in the
        land (of promise)": but when the second of the warnings came to pass, We gathered you
        together in a mingled crowd. <ayah num="105"/> We sent down the (Qur'an) <device
            technique="repetition">in Truth</device>, and <device technique="repetition">in
            Truth</device> has it descended: and We sent thee but <device technique="parallelism">to
            give Glad Tidings and to warn (sinners).</device>
        <ayah num="106"/>
        <device technique="parallelism">(It is) a Qur'an which We have divided (into parts from time
            to time), in order that thou mightest recite it to men at intervals: We have revealed it
            by stages.</device>
        <ayah num="107"/> Say: "Whether ye believe in it or not, it is true that those who were
        given knowledge beforehand, when it is recited to them, fall down on their faces in humble
        prostration, <ayah num="108"/> "And they say: 'Glory to our Lord! Truly has the promise of
        our Lord been fulfilled!'" <ayah num="109"/> They fall down on their faces in tears, and it
        increases their (earnest) humility. <ayah num="110"/> Say: "<device technique="repetition"
            >Call</device> upon Allah, or <device technique="repetition">call</device> upon Rahman:
