# Quran Project Notes

### Surahs for Markup:
- *13: Ar-Ra'd, The Thunder*
- *17: Al-Isra, The Night Journey*

### Markup Strategy:
- **Structural:** `<surah>` , `<translator>` , `<title>` , `<ayah>` 
- **Analytical:** `<comparison> @metaphor @simile` , `<imagery>` , `<repetition> @parallelism @anaphora` , `<allusion>` , `<contrast>` , `<irony>` , `<rhetoricalQuestion>` , `<place>` , `<name>`

### Other Thoughts:
There are sometimes multiple sentences in one verse in the English translations when in the original Arabic, each verse only consists of one sentence. Should we pay attention to this?
Should we tag hyperboles or amplifications? Such as, parallel descriptions given to God "all merciful, all knoweing" etc.
Arabic poetic/lyrical tone gets lost in translation, should we tag these ecphonesis/interjections that appear in the English translations which aim to resemble the literary effect of the Quran?


### Guide for rhetorical devices:

**Simile:**  *"His light is like a niche in which there is a lamp, the lamp is in a crystal, the crystal is like a shining star..."* 
**Metaphor:** *"We have certainly cast veils over their hearts—leaving them unable to comprehend this ˹Quran˺—and deafness in their ears."*

**Imagery:** *"Let them then taste this: boiling water and ˹oozing˺ pus..."* 

**Repetition:** (if you find instances of repetition that are not distinctly parallelism/anaphora) 
**Parallelism:** *"Let the man of wealth provide according to his means. As for the one with limited resources, let him provide according to whatever Allah has given him."*
                 *"They are ˹wilfully˺ deaf, dumb, and blind..."*
**Anaphora:** (could not find example in Quran) *"It rained on his lousy tombstone, and it rained on the grass on his stomach. It rained all over the place."* 

**Allusion:** *"May the hands of Abu Lahab perish, and he ˹himself˺ perish!"* (A symbolical reference is called allusion. Allusion is an in direct reference in a discourse by passing mention or quotation, to something generally familiar.)

**Contrast:** *"Those who disbelieve will have a severe punishment. But those who believe and do good will have forgiveness and a great reward."*

**Irony:** *"Give good news of a painful punishment to hypocrites,"*

**Rhetorical Question:** *"Is there any reward for goodness except goodness?"*

### I found a paper that pertains to similar research and analysis of our project, working with the original Arabic Quran and the English translation.
The author provides a sort of "disclaimer" or moreso context of how rhetorical devices and their purpose and usage are different in every language, therefore
it is important to include an explanation how how we are viewing rehtorical devices in our project from an "English" perspective/linguistic and cultural background:

(lets possibly write up something like this on our project webpage?)

*The problems in translating a text from one language to another are legion. For example,
it is quite common to find western critics referring to what they claim to be incoherence,
inconsistency or lack of harmony in the Qur’anic style (c.f. Hyde Park Christian
Fellowship [1] and Ghoneim [2]). Such views ignore the fact that: 

- it is both inconceivable and impossible to judge one language according to the rules of
 another;
- what might be considered elegant style, or legitimate form, or appropriate function in
 one language is not necessarily looked upon the same way in another;
-  different languages very often express the same thing differently, necessitating
 different phrasing in expression in translation;
- there is no perfect synonymy or exact equivalence between languages in translation.
- there will always be a "translation loss" of different degrees as a result of not only
 linguistic, but also cultural factors.*
