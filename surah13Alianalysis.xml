    <body><ayah num="1"/>A.L.M.R. These are the signs (or verses) of the Book: that which hath been
        revealed unto thee from thy Lord is the <device technique="repetition">Truth</device>; but
        most men believe not. <ayah num="2"/><device technique="repetition">Allah</device>
        <device technique="parallelism">is He Who</device> raised the heavens without any pillars
        that ye can see; is firmly established on the throne (of authority); He has subjected the
        sun and the moon (to his Law)! Each one runs (its course) for a term appointed. He doth
        regulate all affairs, explaining the signs in detail, that ye may believe with certainty in
        the meeting with your Lord. <ayah num="3"/>And it <device technique="parallelism">is He
            who</device> spread out the earth, and set thereon mountains standing firm and (flowing)
        rivers: and fruit of every kind He made in pairs, two and two: He draweth the night as a
        veil o'er the Day. Behold, verily in these things there are signs for those who consider!
            <ayah num="4"/>And in the earth are tracts (diverse though) neighbouring, and gardens of
        vines and fields sown with corn, and palm trees - growing out of single roots or otherwise:
        watered with the same water, yet some of them We make more excellent than others to eat.
        Behold, verily in these things there are signs for those who understand! <ayah num="5"/>If
        thou dost marvel (at their want of faith), strange is their saying: "When we are (actually)
        dust, shall we indeed then be in a creation renewed?" They are those who deny their Lord!
        They are those round whose necks will be yokes (of servitude): they will be Companions of
        the Fire, to dwell therein (for aye)! <ayah num="6"/>They ask thee to hasten on the evil in
        preference to the good: Yet have come to pass, before them, (many) exemplary punishments!
            <device technique="parallelism">But verily thy Lord is full of forgiveness for mankind
            for their wrong-doing, and verily thy Lord is (also) strict in punishment.</device>
        <ayah num="7"/>And the Unbelievers say: "Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?"
        But thou art truly a warner, and to every people a guide. <ayah num="8"/><device
            technique="repetition">Allah</device> doth know what every female (womb) doth bear, by
        how much the wombs fall short (of their time or number) or do exceed. Every single thing is
        before His sight, in (due) proportion. <ayah num="9"/>He knoweth the unseen and that which
        is open: <comparison type="metaphor">He is the Great, the Most High.</comparison>
        <ayah num="10"/>It is the same (to Him) whether any of you conceal his speech or declare it
        openly; whether he lie hid by night or walk forth freely by day. <ayah num="11"/>For each
        (such person) there are (angels) in succession, before and behind him: They guard him by
        command of <device technique="repetition">Allah</device>. <device technique="repetition"
            >Allah</device> does not change a people's lot unless they change what is in their
        hearts. But when (once) <device technique="repetition">Allah</device> willeth a people's
        punishment, there can be no turning it back, nor will they find, besides Him, any to
        protect. <ayah num="12"/>It is He Who doth show you the lightning, by way both of fear and
        of hope: It is He Who doth raise up the clouds, heavy with (fertilising) rain! <ayah
            num="13"/>Nay, thunder repeateth His praises, and so do the angels, with awe: He
        flingeth the loud-voiced thunder-bolts, and therewith He striketh whomsoever He will..yet
        these (are the men) who (dare to) dispute about <device technique="repetition"
            >Allah</device>, with the strength of His power (supreme)! <ayah num="14"/>For Him
        (alone) is prayer in <device technique="repetition">Truth</device>: any others that they
        call upon besides Him hear them no more than if they were to stretch forth their hands for
        water to reach their mouths but it reaches them not: for the prayer of those without Faith
        is nothing but (futile) wandering (in the mind). <ayah num="15"/>Whatever beings there are
        in the heavens and the earth do prostrate themselves to <device technique="repetition"
            >Allah</device> (Acknowledging subjection),- with good-will or in spite of themselves:
        so do their shadows in the morning and evenings. <ayah num="16"/>Say: "Who is the Lord and
        Sustainer of the heavens and the earth?" Say: "(It is) <device technique="repetition"
            >Allah</device>." Say: "Do ye then take (for worship) protectors other than Him, such as
        have no power either for good or for harm to themselves?" Say: "Are the blind equal with
        those who see? Or the depths of darkness equal with light?" Or do they assign to <device
            technique="repetition">Allah</device> partners who have created (anything) as He has
        created, so that the creation seemed to them similar? Say: "<device technique="repetition"
            >Allah</device> is the Creator of all things: He is the One, the Supreme and
        Irresistible." <ayah num="17"/>He sends down water from the skies, and the channels flow,
        each according to its measure: But the torrent bears away to foam that mounts up to the
        surface. Even so, from that (ore) which they heat in the fire, to make ornaments or utensils
        therewith, there is a scum likewise. Thus doth <device technique="parallelism"><device
                technique="repetition">Allah</device> (by parables) show forth</device>
        <device technique="repetition">Truth</device> and Vanity. <comparison type="simile">For the
            scum disappears like forth cast out;</comparison> while that which is for the good of
        mankind remains on the earth. Thus doth <device technique="parallelism"><device
                technique="repetition">Allah</device> set forth parables.</device>
        <ayah num="18"/>For those who respond to their Lord, are (all) good things. But those who
        respond not to Him,- Even if they had all that is in the heavens and on earth, and as much
        more, (in vain) would they offer it for ransom. For them will the reckoning be terrible:
        their abode will be Hell,- what a bed of misery! <ayah num="19"/><comparison type="simile"
            >Is then one who doth know that that which hath been revealed unto thee from thy Lord is
            the <device technique="repetition">Truth</device>, like one who is blind?</comparison>
        It is those who are endued with understanding that receive admonition;- <ayah num="20"
        />Those who fulfil the covenant of <device technique="repetition">Allah</device> and fail
        not in their plighted word; <ayah num="21"/>Those who join together those things which
            <device technique="repetition">Allah</device> hath commanded to be joined, hold their
        Lord in awe, and fear the terrible reckoning; <ayah num="22"/>Those who patiently persevere,
        seeking the countenance of their Lord; Establish regular prayers; spend, out of (the gifts)
        We have bestowed for their sustenance, secretly and openly; and turn off Evil with good: for
        such there is the final attainment of the (eternal) home,- <ayah num="23"/>Gardens of
        perpetual bliss: they shall enter there, as well as the righteous among their fathers, their
        spouses, and their offspring: and angels shall enter unto them from every gate (with the
        salutation): <ayah num="24"/>"Peace unto you for that ye persevered in patience! Now how
        excellent is the final home!" <ayah num="25"/>But those who break the Covenant of <device
            technique="repetition">Allah</device>, after having plighted their word thereto, and cut
        asunder those things which <device technique="repetition">Allah</device> has commanded to be
        joined, and work mischief in the land;- on them is the curse; for them is the terrible home!
            <ayah num="26"/><device technique="repetition">Allah</device> doth enlarge, or grant by
        (strict) measure, the sustenance (which He giveth) to whomso He pleaseth. (The wordly)
        rejoice in the life of this world: But the life of this world is but little comfort in the
        Hereafter. <ayah num="27"/>The Unbelievers say: "Why is not a sign sent down to him from his
        Lord?" Say: "Truly <device technique="repetition">Allah</device> leaveth, to stray, whom He
        will; But He guideth to Himself those who turn to Him in penitence,- <ayah num="28"/>"Those
        who believe, and whose hearts find satisfaction in the remembrance of <device
            technique="repetition">Allah</device>: for without doubt in the remembrance of <device
            technique="repetition">Allah</device> do hearts find satisfaction. <ayah num="29"/>"For
        those who believe and work righteousness, is (every) blessedness, and a beautiful place of
        (final) return." <ayah num="30"/>Thus have we sent thee amongst a People before whom (long
        since) have (other) Peoples (gone and) passed away; in order that thou mightest rehearse
        unto them what We send down unto thee by inspiration; yet do they reject (Him), the Most
        Gracious! Say: "He is my Lord! There is no god but He! On Him is my trust, and to Him do I
        turn!" <ayah num="31"/>If there were a Qur'an with which mountains were moved, or the earth
        were cloven asunder, or the dead were made to speak, (this would be the one!) But, truly,
        the command is with <device technique="repetition">Allah</device> in all things! Do not the
        Believers know, that, had <device technique="repetition">Allah</device> (so) willed, He
        could have guided all mankind (to the right)? But the Unbelievers,- never will disaster
        cease to seize them for their (ill) deeds, or to settle close to their homes, until the
        promise of <device technique="repetition">Allah</device> come to pass, for, verily, <device
            technique="repetition">Allah</device> will not fail in His promise. <ayah num="32"
        />Mocked were (many) messengers before thee: but I granted respite to the unbelievers, and
        finally I punished them: Then how (terrible) was my requital! <ayah num="33"/>Is then He who
        standeth over every soul (and knoweth) all that it doth, (like any others)? <device
            technique="irony">And yet they ascribe partners to <device technique="repetition"
                >Allah</device>.</device> Say: <device technique="rhetoricalQuestion">"But name
            them! is it that ye will inform Him of something he knoweth not on earth, or is it
            (just) a show of words?"</device> Nay! to those who believe not, their pretence seems
        pleasing, but they are kept back (thereby) from the path. And those whom <device
            technique="repetition">Allah</device> leaves to stray, no one can guide. <ayah num="34"
            /><device technique="parallelism">For them is a penalty in the life of this world, but
            harder, truly, is the penalty of the Hereafter:</device> and defender have they none
        against <device technique="repetition">Allah</device>. <ayah num="35"/>The parable of the
        Garden which the righteous are promised!- beneath it flow rivers: perpetual is the enjoyment
        thereof and the shade therein: such is the end of the Righteous; and the end of Unbelievers
        in the Fire. <ayah num="36"/>Those to whom We have given the Book rejoice at what hath been
        revealed unto thee: but there are among the clans those who reject a part thereof. Say: "I
        am commanded to worship <device technique="repetition">Allah</device>, and not to join
        partners with Him. <device technique="parallelism">Unto Him do I call, and unto Him is my
            return.</device>" <ayah num="37"/>Thus have We revealed it to be a judgment of authority
        in Arabic. Wert thou to follow their (vain) desires after the knowledge which hath reached
        thee, then wouldst thou find neither protector nor defender against <device
            technique="repetition">Allah</device>. <ayah num="38"/>We did send messengers before
        thee, and appointed for them wives and children: and it was never the part of a messenger to
        bring a sign except as <device technique="repetition">Allah</device> permitted (or
        commanded). For each period is a Book (revealed). <ayah num="39"/><device
            technique="repetition">Allah</device> doth blot out or confirm what He pleaseth: with
        Him is the Mother of the Book. <ayah num="40"/>Whether We shall show thee (within
            <repetiton>thy</repetiton> life-time) part of what we promised them or take to ourselves
            <device technique="repetition">thy</device> soul (before it is all accomplished),-
            <device technique="repetition">thy</device> duty is to make (the Message) reach them: it
        is our part to call them to account. <ayah num="41"/>See they not that We gradually reduce
        the land (in their control) from its outlying borders? <device technique="parallelism"
            >(Where) <device technique="repetition">Allah</device> commands, there is none to put
            back His Command:</device> and He is swift in calling to account. <ayah num="42"/>Those
        before them did (also) devise plots; but in all things the master-planning is <device
            technique="repetition">Allah</device>'s He <device technique="repetition"
            >knoweth</device> the doings of every soul: and soon will the Unbelievers <device
            technique="repetition">know</device> who gets home in the end. <ayah num="43"/>The
        Unbelievers say: "No messenger art thou." Say: "Enough for a witness between me and you is
            <device technique="repetition">Allah</device>, and such as have knowledge of the
        Book."</body>
