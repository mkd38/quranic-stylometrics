        <ayah n="1"> Alif. Lam. Mim. Ra. These are verses of the Scripture. That which is revealed
            unto thee from thy Lord is the Truth, but most of mankind believe not. </ayah>
        <ayah n="2"> Allah it is Who raised up the heavens without visible supports, then mounted
            the Throne, and <imagery>compelled the sun and the moon to be of service, each runneth
                unto an appointed term </imagery>; He ordereth the course; He detaileth the
            revelations, that haply ye may be certain of the meeting with your Lord. </ayah>
        <ayah n="3"> And He it is Who <imagery>spread out the earth and placed therein firm hills
                and flowing streams, and of all fruits He placed therein two spouses (male and
                female)</imagery>. He covereth the night with the day. <emph>Lo!</emph> herein
            verily are portents for people who take thought. </ayah>
        <ayah n="4"> And <imagery>in the Earth are neighbouring tracts, vineyards and ploughed
                lands, and date-palms, like and unlike, which are <repetition device="anaphora"
                    >watered with one water</repetition></imagery>. And we have made some of them to
            excel others in fruit. <emph>Lo!</emph> herein <emph>verily</emph> are portents for
            people who have sense. </ayah>
        <ayah n="5">
            <repetition device="anaphora">And if thou wonderest, then wondrous is their
                saying</repetition>: When <comparison device="metaphor">we are dust</comparison>, are
            we then forsooth (to be raised) in a new creation? Such are they who disbelieve in their
            Lord; <imagery>such have carcans on their necks</imagery>; such are rightful owners of
            the Fire, they will abide therein. </ayah>
        <ayah n="6"> And they bid thee hasten on the evil rather than the good, when exemplary
            punishments have indeed occurred before them. But <emph>lo!</emph>
            <repetition device="parallelism">thy Lord is rich in pardon for mankind despite their
                wrong, and <emph>lo!</emph> thy Lord is strong in punishment.</repetition>
        </ayah>
        <ayah n="7"> Those who disbelieve say: If only some portent were sent down upon him from his
                <emph>Lord!</emph> Thou art a warner only, and for every folk a guide. </ayah>
        <ayah n="8"> Allah knoweth that which every female beareth and that which the wombs absorb
            and that which they grow. And everything with Him is measured. </ayah>
        <ayah n="9"> He is the <amplification>Knower of the Invisible and the
                Visible</amplification>,<amplification> the Great</amplification>,
                <amplification>the High Exalted</amplification>. </ayah>
        <ayah n="10">
            <comparison device="contrast">Alike of you is he who hideth the saying and he who
                noiseth it abroad</comparison>, <comparison device="contrast">he who lurketh in the
                night and he who goeth freely in the daytime.</comparison>
        </ayah>
        <ayah n="11"> For him are angels ranged before him and behind him, who guard him by Allah's
            command. <emph>Lo!</emph> Allah changeth not the condition of a folk until they (first)
            change that which is in their hearts; and if Allah willeth misfortune for a folk there
            is none that can repel it, nor have they a defender beside Him. </ayah>
        <ayah n="12"> He it is Who <imagery>showeth you the lightning, a fear and a hope, and
                raiseth the heavy clouds.</imagery>
        </ayah>
        <ayah n="13"> The thunder hymneth His praise and (so do) the angels for awe of Him.
                <imagery>He launcheth the thunderbolts and smiteth with them</imagery> whom He will
            while they dispute (in doubt) concerning Allah, and He is mighty in wrath. </ayah>
        <ayah n="14"> Unto Him is the real prayer. Those unto whom they pray beside Allah respond to
            them not at all, <comparison device="simile">save as (is the response to) one who
                stretcheth forth his hands toward water (asking) that it may come unto his mouth,
                and it will never reach it</comparison>. The prayer of disbelievers goeth (far)
            astray. </ayah>
        <ayah n="15"> And unto Allah falleth prostrate whosoever is in the heavens and the earth,
            willingly or unwillingly, as do their shadows in the morning and the evening hours. </ayah>
        <ayah n="16"> Say (<emph>O</emph>
            <name>Muhammad</name>): Who is <amplification>Lord of the heavens and the
                earth</amplification>? Say: Allah. Say: Take ye then (others) beside Him for
            protectors, which, even for themselves, have neither benefit nor hurt? Say: Is the blind
            man equal to the seer, or is darkness equal to light? Or assign they unto Allah partners
            who created the like of His creation so that the creation (which they made and His
            creation) seemed alike to them? Say: Allah is the <amplification>Creator of all
                things</amplification>, and He is <amplification>the One</amplification>,
                <amplification>the Almighty</amplification>. </ayah>
        <ayah n="17">
            <imagery>He sendeth down water from the sky, so that valleys flow according to their
                measure, and the flood beareth (on its surface) swelling foam - from that which they
                smelt in the fire in order to make ornaments and tools riseth a foam like unto it
            </imagery> - thus Allah coineth (the similitude of) the true and the false. Then, as for
                <comparison device="simile">the foam, it passeth away as scum upon the
                banks</comparison>, while, as for that which is of use to mankind, it remaineth in
            the earth. Thus Allah coineth the similitudes. </ayah>
        <ayah n="18"> For those who answered Allah's call is bliss; and for those who answered not
            His call, if they had all that is in the earth, and therewith the like thereof, they
            would proffer it as ransom. Such will have a woeful reckoning, and their habitation will
            be hell, a dire abode. </ayah>
        <ayah n="19">
            <rhetoricalQuestion><comparison device="simile">Is he who knoweth that what is revealed
                    unto thee from thy Lord is the truth like him who is
                blind?</comparison></rhetoricalQuestion> But only men of understanding heed; </ayah>
        <ayah n="20"> Such as keep the pact of Allah, and break not the covenant; </ayah>
        <ayah n="21"> Such as <repetition device="motif">unite that which Allah hath commandeth
                should be joined</repetition>, and fear their Lord, and dread a woeful reckoning; </ayah>
        <ayah n="22"> Such as persevere in seeking their Lord's Countenance and are regular in
            prayer and spend of that which We bestow upon them secretly and openly, and overcome
            evil with good. Theirs will be the sequel of the (heavenly) Home, </ayah>
        <ayah n="23"> Gardens of Eden which they enter, along with all who do right of their fathers
            and their helpmeets and their seed. The angels enter unto them from every gate, </ayah>
        <ayah n="24"> (Saying): Peace be unto you because ye persevered. Ah, passing sweet will be
            the sequel of the (heavenly) Home. </ayah>
        <ayah n="25"> And those who break the covenant of Allah after ratifying it, and <repetition
                device="motif">sever that which Allah hath commanded should be joined</repetition>,
            and make mischief in the earth: theirs is the curse and theirs the ill abode. </ayah>
        <ayah n="26"> Allah enlargeth livelihood for whom He will, and straiteneth (it for whom He
            will); and they rejoice in the life of the world, whereas the life of the world is but
            brief comfort as compared with the Hereafter. </ayah>
        <ayah n="27"> Those who disbelieve say: If only a portent were sent down upon him from his
                Lord<emph>!</emph> Say: <emph>Lo!</emph> Allah sendeth whom He will astray, and
            guideth unto Himself all who turn (unto Him), </ayah>
        <ayah n="28"> Who have believed and whose hearts have rest in the remembrance of Allah.
                <emph>Verily</emph> in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest! </ayah>
        <ayah n="29"> Those who believe and do right: Joy is for them, and bliss (their) journey's
            end. </ayah>
        <ayah n="30"> Thus We send thee (<emph>O</emph>
            <name>Muhammad</name>) unto a nation, before whom other nations have passed away, that
            thou mayst recite unto them that which We have inspired in thee, while they are
            disbelievers in the Beneficent. Say: He is my Lord; there is no Allah save Him. In Him
            do I put my trust and unto Him is my recourse. </ayah>
        <ayah n="31"> Had it been possible for a <imagery>Lecture to cause the mountains to move, or
                the earth to be torn asunder, or the dead to speak,</imagery> (this Qur'an would
            have done so). Nay, but Allah's is the whole command. <rhetoricalQuestion>Do not those
                who believe know that, had Allah willed, He could have guided all
                mankind?</rhetoricalQuestion> As for those who disbelieve, disaster ceaseth not to
            strike them because of what they do, or it dwelleth near their home until the threat of
            Allah come to pass. <emph>Lo!</emph> Allah faileth not to keep the tryst. </ayah>
        <ayah n="32"> And <emph>verily</emph> messengers (of Allah) were mocked before thee, but
            long I bore with those who disbelieved. At length I seized them, and
                <rhetoricalQuestion>how (awful) was My punishment<emph>!</emph></rhetoricalQuestion>
        </ayah>
        <ayah n="33">
            <rhetoricalQuestion>Is He Who is aware of the deserts of every soul (as he who is aware
                of nothing)?</rhetoricalQuestion> Yet they ascribe unto Allah partners. Say: Name
            them. Is it that ye would inform Him of something which He knoweth not in the earth? Or
            is it but a way of speaking? Nay but their contrivance is made seeming fair for those
            who disbelieve and they are kept from the right road. He whom Allah sendeth astray, for
            him there is no guide. </ayah>
        <ayah n="34"> For them is torment in the life of the world, and <emph>verily</emph> the doom
            of the Hereafter is more painful, and they have no defender from Allah. </ayah>
        <ayah n="35"> A similitude of the Garden which is promised unto those who keep their duty
            (to Allah): <imagery>Underneath it rivers flow; its food is everlasting, and its
                shade</imagery>; <repetition device="parallelism">this is the reward of those who
                keep their duty, while the reward of disbelievers is the Fire.</repetition>
        </ayah>
        <ayah n="36"> Those unto whom We gave the Scripture rejoice in that which is revealed unto
            thee. And of the clans there are who deny some of it. Say: I am commanded only that I
            serve Allah and ascribe unto Him no partner. <repetition device="anaphora">Unto Him I
                cry, and unto Him is my return.</repetition>
        </ayah>
        <ayah n="37"> Thus have We revealed it, a decisive utterance in Arabic; and if thou shouldst
            follow their desires after that which hath come unto thee of knowledge, then truly
            wouldst thou have from Allah no protecting friend nor defender. </ayah>
        <ayah n="38"> And <emph>verily</emph> We sent messengers (to mankind) before thee, and We
            appointed for them wives and offspring, and it was not (given) to any messenger that he

        <ayah n="39">
            <repetition device="parallelism">Allah effaceth what He will, and establisheth (what He
