            verily will work corruption in the earth twice, and ye will become great tyrants. </ayah>
        <ayah n="5"> So when the time for the first of the two came, We roused against you slaves of
            Ours of great might who ravaged (your) country, and it was a threat performed. </ayah>
        <ayah n="6"> Then we gave you once again your turn against them, and We aided you with
            wealth and children and made you more in soldiery. </ayah>

            (We roused against you others of Our slaves) to ravage you, and <comparison device="simile">to enter the Temple
                even as they entered it the first time</comparison>, and to

            portent of the night, and We make the portent of the day sight-giving, that ye may seek
            bounty from your Lord, and that ye may know the computation of the years, and the

            save that they said: Hath Allah sent a mortal as (His) messenger? </ayah>
        <ayah n="95"> Say: If there were in the earth angels walking secure, We had sent down for

        <ayah n="97"> And he whom Allah guideth, he is led aright; while, as for him whom He sendeth
            astray, for them thou wilt find no protecting friends beside Him, and We shall assemble
            them on the Day of Resurrection <repetition device="motif">on their faces</repetition>,<repetition device="motif"> blind, dumb

        <ayah n="98"> That is their reward because they disbelieved Our revelations and said:
                <comparison device="metaphor">When we are bones and fragments </comparison>shall we, forsooth, be
                raised up as a new creation?
        </ayah>
        <ayah n="99"> Have they not seen that Allah Who created the heavens and the earth is Able to
            create the like of them, and hath appointed for them an end whereof there is no doubt?
            But the wrong-doers refuse aught save disbelief. </ayah>
        <ayah n="100"> Say (unto them): If ye possessed the treasures of the mercy of my Lord, ye

        <ayah n="101"> And <emph>verily</emph> We gave unto <name>Moses</name> <allusion>nine tokens</allusion>,
            clear proofs (of Allah's Sovereignty). Do but ask the <name>Children of Israel</name> how he came
            unto them, then <name>Pharaoh</name> said unto him: <emph>Lo!</emph> I deem thee
            one bewitched, O <name>Moses</name>. </ayah>
        <ayah n="102"> He said: In truth thou knowest that none sent down these (portents) save the
            Lord of the heavens and the earth as proofs, and <emph>lo!</emph> (for
            my part) I deem thee lost, <emph>O</emph> Pharaoh. </ayah>
        <ayah n="103"> And he wished to scare them from the land, but We drowned him and those with
            him, all together. </ayah>
        <ayah n="104"> And We said unto the <name>Children of Israel</name> after him: Dwell in the land; but
            when the promise of the Hereafter cometh to pass We shall bring you as a crowd gathered
            out of various nations. </ayah>
        <ayah n="105"> With truth have We sent it down, and with truth hath it descended. And We

        <ayah n="106"> And (it is) a Qur'an that We have divided, that thou mayst recite it unto
            mankind at intervals, and We have revealed it by (successive) revelation. </ayah>
        <ayah n="107"> Say: Believe therein or believe not, <emph>lo!</emph> those

        <ayah n="108"> Saying: Glory to our Lord<emph>!</emph>
