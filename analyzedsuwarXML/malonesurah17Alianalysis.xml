        <ayah n="1">
            <emph>Glory to (Allah)</emph> Who did take His servant for a Journey by night from the
            Sacred Mosque to the farthest Mosque, whose precincts We did bless,- in order that We
            might show him some of Our Signs: for He is the One Who heareth and seeth (all
            things).</ayah>
        <ayah n="2"> We gave <name>Moses</name> the Book, and made it a Guide to the Children of
                <place>Israel</place>, (commanding): "Take not other than Me as Disposer of (your)
            affairs."</ayah>
        <ayah n="3">
            <emph>O</emph> ye that are sprung from those whom We carried (in the Ark) with
                <name>Noah</name><emph>!</emph>
            <emph>Verily</emph> he was a devotee most grateful.</ayah>
        <ayah n="4"> And We gave (Clear) Warning to the <name>Children of Israel</name> in the Book,
            that <repetition device="parallelism">twice would they do mischief on the earth and be
                elated with mighty arrogance (and twice would they be
                punished)<emph>!</emph></repetition></ayah>
        <ayah n="5"> When the first of the warnings came to pass, We sent against you Our servants
            given to terrible warfare: They entered the very inmost parts of your homes; and it was
            a warning (completely) fulfilled.</ayah>
        <ayah n="6"> Then did We grant you the Return as against them: We gave you increase in
            resources and sons, and made you the more numerous in man-power.</ayah>
        <ayah n="7"> If <repetition device="anaphora">ye did well, ye did well for yourselves; if ye
                did evil, (ye did it) against yourselves. </repetition> So when the second of the
            warnings came to pass, (We permitted your enemies) <comparison device="metaphor">to
                disfigure your faces</comparison>, and to <comparison device="simile">enter your
                Temple as they had entered it before</comparison>, and to visit with destruction all
            that fell into their power.</ayah>
        <ayah n="8"> It may be that your Lord may (yet) show Mercy unto you; <repetition
                device="parallelism">but if ye revert (to your sins), We shall revert (to Our
                punishments):</repetition> And we have made Hell a prison for those who reject (all
            Faith).</ayah>
        <ayah n="9">
            <emph>Verily</emph> this Qur'an doth guide to that which is most right (or stable), and
            giveth the Glad Tidings to the Believers who work deeds of righteousness, that they
            shall have a magnificent reward;</ayah>
        <ayah n="10"> And to those who believe not in the Hereafter, (it announceth) that We have
            prepared for them a Penalty Grievous (indeed).</ayah>
        <ayah n="11">
            <irony>The prayer that man should make for good, he maketh for evil;</irony> for man is
            given to hasty (deeds).</ayah>
        <ayah n="12">
            <repetition device="parallelism">We have made the Night and the Day as two (of Our)
                Signs: the Sign of the Night have We obscured, while the Sign of the Day We have
                made to enlighten you; that ye may seek bounty from your Lord, and that ye may know
                the number and count of the years:</repetition> all things have We explained in
            detail.</ayah>
        <ayah n="13"> Every man's fate We have fastened on his own neck: On the Day of Judgment We
            shall bring out for him a scroll, which he will see spread open.</ayah>
        <ayah n="14"> (It will be said to him:) "Read thine (own) record: Sufficient is thy soul
            this day to make out an account against thee."</ayah>
        <ayah n="15">
            <repetition device="parallelism">Who receiveth guidance, receiveth it for his own
                benefit: who goeth astray doth so to his own loss</repetition>: <repetition
                device="anaphora">No bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another</repetition>:
            nor would We visit with Our Wrath until We had sent an messenger (to give
            warning).</ayah>
        <ayah n="16"> When We decide to destroy a population, We (first) send a definite order to
            those among them who are given the good things of this life and yet transgress; so that
            the word is proved true against them: then (it is) We destroy them utterly.</ayah>
        <ayah n="17">
            <rhetoricalQuestion>How many generations have We destroyed after
                <name>Noah</name>?</rhetoricalQuestion> and enough is thy Lord to note and see the
            sins of His servants.</ayah>
        <ayah n="18"> If any do wish for the transitory things (of this life), We readily grant them
            - <repetition device="anaphora">such things as We will, to such person as We
                will</repetition>: in the end have We provided Hell for them: they will burn
            therein, <repetition device="motif">disgraced and rejected</repetition>.</ayah>
        <ayah n="19"> Those who do wish for the (things of) the Hereafter, and <repetition
                device="anaphora">strive therefore with all due striving,</repetition> and have
            Faith,- they are the ones whose striving is acceptable (to Allah).</ayah>
        <ayah n="20"> Of the bounties of thy Lord We bestow freely on all- These as well as those:
            The bounties of thy Lord are not closed (to anyone).</ayah>
        <ayah n="21"> See how We have bestowed more on some than on others; but <emph>verily</emph>
            the Hereafter is more in rank and gradation and more in excellence.</ayah>
        <ayah n="22"> Take not with Allah another object of worship; or thou (<emph>O man!</emph>)
            wilt sit in disgrace and destitution.</ayah>
        <ayah n="23"> Thy Lord hath decreed that ye worship none but Him, and that ye be kind to
            parents. Whether one or both of them attain old age in thy life, say not to them a word
            of contempt, nor repel them, but address them in terms of honour.</ayah>
        <ayah n="24"> And, out of kindness, <comparison device="metaphor">lower to them the wing of
                humility</comparison>, and say: "My Lord<emph>!</emph> bestow on them thy Mercy even
            as they cherished me in childhood."</ayah>
        <ayah n="25"> Your Lord <amplification>knoweth best</amplification> what is in your hearts:
            If ye do deeds of righteousness, <emph>verily</emph> He is <amplification>Most
                Forgiving</amplification> to those who turn to Him again and again (in true
            penitence).</ayah>
        <ayah n="26"> And render to the kindred their due rights, as (also) to those in want, and to
            the wayfarer: But squander not (your wealth) in the manner of a spendthrift.</ayah>
        <ayah n="27">
            <emph>Verily</emph>
            <comparison device="metaphor">spendthrifts are brothers of the Evil Ones</comparison>;
            and the <allusion>Evil One</allusion> is to his Lord (himself) ungrateful.</ayah>
        <ayah n="28"> And even if thou hast to turn away from them in pursuit of the Mercy from thy
            Lord which thou dost expect, yet speak to them a word of easy kindness.</ayah>
        <ayah n="29">
            <comparison device="simile">Make not thy hand tied (like a niggard's) to thy
                neck,</comparison> nor stretch it forth to its utmost reach, so that thou become
            blameworthy and destitute.</ayah>
        <ayah n="30">
            <emph>Verily</emph> thy Lord doth provide sustenance in abundance for whom He pleaseth,
            and He provideth in a just measure. For <amplification>He doth know and regard
                all</amplification> His servants.</ayah>
        <ayah n="31"> Kill not your children for fear of want: We shall provide sustenance for them
            as well as for you. <emph>Verily</emph> the killing of them is a great sin.</ayah>
        <ayah n="32"> Nor come nigh to adultery: for it is a shameful (deed) and an evil, opening
            the road (to other evils).</ayah>
        <ayah n="33"> Nor take life - which Allah has made sacred - except for just cause. And if
            anyone is slain wrongfully, we have given his heir authority (to demand qisas or to
            forgive): but let him not exceed bounds in the matter of taking life; for he is helped
            (by the Law).</ayah>
        <ayah n="34"> Come not nigh to the orphan's property except to improve it, until he attains
            the age of full strength; and fulfil (every) engagement, for (every) engagement will be
            enquired into (on the Day of Reckoning).</ayah>
        <ayah n="35">
            <repetition device="anaphora">Give full measure when ye measure</repetition>, and weigh
            with a balance that is straight: that is the most fitting and the most advantageous in
            the final determination.</ayah>
        <ayah n="36"> And pursue not that of which thou hast no knowledge; <repetition
                device="motif">for every act of hearing, or of seeing or of (feeling in) the
                heart</repetition> will be enquired into (on the Day of Reckoning).</ayah>
        <ayah n="37"> Nor walk on the earth with insolence: for thou canst not rend the earth
            asunder, nor reach the mountains in height.</ayah>
        <ayah n="38"> Of all such things the evil is hateful in the sight of thy Lord.</ayah>
        <ayah n="39"> These are among the (precepts of) wisdom, which thy Lord has revealed to thee.
            Take not, with Allah, another object of worship, lest thou shouldst be thrown into Hell,
