        <ayah n="1">
            <device type="praise">Glory to (Allah)</device> Who did take His servant for a Journey
            by night from the Sacred Mosque to the farthest Mosque, whose precincts We did bless,-
            in order that We might show him some of Our Signs: for He is the One Who heareth and
            seeth (all things).</ayah>
        <ayah n="2">
            <device type="allusion">We gave Moses the Book, and made it a Guide to the Children of
                Israel, (commanding): "Take not other than Me as Disposer of (your)
                affairs."</device></ayah>
        <ayah n="3">
            <device type="allusion">O ye that are sprung from those whom We carried (in the Ark)
                with Noah! Verily he was a devotee most grateful.</device></ayah>
        <ayah n="4"> And We gave (Clear) Warning to the Children of Israel in the Book, that <device
                type="anaphora">twice would they</device> do mischief on the earth and be elated
            with mighty arrogance (and <device type="anaphora">twice would they</device> be
            punished)!</ayah>
        <ayah n="5"> When the first of the warnings came to pass, We sent against you Our servants
            given to terrible warfare: They entered the very inmost parts of your homes; and it was
            a warning (completely) fulfilled.</ayah>
        <ayah n="6"> Then did We grant you the Return as against them: <device type="parallelism">We
                gave you increase in resources and sons, and made you the more nerous in
                man-power.</device></ayah>
        <ayah n="7"> If <device type="anaphora">ye did</device> well, <device type="anaphora">ye
                did</device> well for yourselves; if <device type="anaphora">ye did</device> evil,
                (<device type="anaphora">ye did</device> it) against yourselves. So when the second
            of the warnings came to pass, (We permitted your enemies) <device type="metaphor">to
                disfigure your faces</device>, and to <device type="allusion">enter your Temple as
                they had entered it before</device>, and to visit with destruction all that fell
            into their power.</ayah>
        <ayah n="8"> It may be that your Lord may (yet) show Mercy unto you; <device
                type="parallelism">but if ye revert (to your sins), We shall revert (to Our
                punishments):</device> And <device type="irony">we have made Hell a prison</device>
            for those who reject (all Faith).</ayah>
        <ayah n="9"> Verily this Qur'an doth guide to that which is most right (or stable), and
            giveth the Glad Tidings to the Believers who work deeds of righteousness, that they
            shall have a magnificent reward;</ayah>
        <ayah n="10"> And to those who believe not in the Hereafter, (it announceth) that We have
            prepared for them a Penalty Grievous (indeed).</ayah>
        <ayah n="11">
            <device type="irony">The prayer that man should make for good, he maketh for
                evil;</device> for man is given to hasty (deeds).</ayah>
        <ayah n="12"> We have made the Night and the Day as two (of Our) Signs: <device
                type="parallelism">the Sign of the Night have We obscured, while the Sign of the Day
                We have made to enlighten you;</device>
            <device type="anaphora">that ye may</device> seek bounty from your Lord, and <device
                type="anaphora">that ye may</device> know the nber and count of the years: all
            things have We explained in detail.</ayah>
        <ayah n="13">
            <device type="metaphor">Every man's fate We have fastened on his own neck:</device> On
            the Day of Judgment We shall bring out for him a scroll, which he will see spread
            open.</ayah>
        <ayah n="14"> (It will be said to him:) "Read thine (own) record: Sufficient is thy soul
            this day to make out an account against thee."</ayah>
        <ayah n="15">
            <device type="parallelism">Who receiveth guidance, receiveth it for his own
                benefit</device>: who goeth astray doth so to his own loss: No bearer of burdens can
            bear the burden of another: nor would We visit with Our Wrath until We had sent an
            messenger (to give warning).</ayah>
        <ayah n="16"> When We decide to destroy a population, We (first) send a definite order to
            those among them who are given the good things of this life and yet transgress; so that
            the word is proved true against them: then (it is) We destroy them utterly.</ayah>
        <ayah n="17">
            <device type="rhetoricalQuestion">How many generations have We destroyed after
                Noah?</device> and enough is thy Lord to note and see the sins of His
            servants.</ayah>
        <ayah n="18">
            <device type="irony">If any do wish for the transitory things (of this life), We readily
                grant them - <device type="parallelism">such things as We will, to such person as We
                    will</device>: in the end have We provided Hell for them: they will burn
                therein, disgraced and rejected.</device></ayah>
        <ayah n="19"> Those who do wish for the (things of) the Hereafter, and strive therefor with
            all due striving, and have Faith,- they are the ones whose striving is acceptable (to
            Allah).</ayah>
        <ayah n="20"> Of the bounties of thy Lord We bestow freely on all- These as well as those:
            The bounties of thy Lord are not closed (to anyone).</ayah>
        <ayah n="21">
            <device type="contrast">See how We have bestowed more on some than on others</device>;
            but verily the Hereafter is more in rank and gradation and more in excellence.</ayah>
        <ayah n="22"> Take not with Allah another object of worship; or thou (O man!) wilt sit in
            disgrace and destitution.</ayah>
        <ayah n="23"> Thy Lord hath decreed that ye worship none but Him, and that ye be kind to
            parents. Whether one or both of them attain old age in thy life, <device
                type="parallelism">say not to them a word of contempt, nor repel them, but address
                them in terms of honour.</device></ayah>
        <ayah n="24"> And, out of kindness, <device type="metaphor">lower to them the wing of
                humility</device>, and say: "My Lord! bestow on them thy Mercy even as they
            cherished me in childhood."</ayah>
        <ayah n="25"> Your Lord knoweth best what is in your hearts: If ye do deeds of
            righteousness, verily He is Most Forgiving to those who turn to Him again and again (in
            true penitence).</ayah>
        <ayah n="26"> And render to the kindred their due rights, as (also) to those in want, and to
            the wayfarer: But squander not (your wealth) in the manner of a spendthrift.</ayah>
        <ayah n="27">
            <device type="parallelism">Verily spendthrifts are brothers of the Evil Ones; and the
                Evil One is to his Lord (himself) ungrateful.</device></ayah>
        <ayah n="28"> And even if thou hast to turn away from them in pursuit of the Mercy from thy
            Lord which thou dost expect, yet speak to them a word of easy kindness.</ayah>
        <ayah n="29">
            <device type="simile">Make not thy hand tied (like a niggard's) to thy neck, nor stretch
                it forth to its utmost reach, so that thou become blameworthy and

        <ayah n="30"> Verily thy Lord doth provide sustenance in abundance for whom He pleaseth, and
            He provideth in a just measure. For He doth know and regard all His servants.</ayah>
        <ayah n="31"> Kill not your children for fear of want: We shall provide sustenance for them
            as well as for you. Verily the killing of them is a great sin.</ayah>
        <ayah n="32"> Nor come nigh to adultery: for it is a shameful (deed) and an evil, opening
            the road (to other evils).</ayah>
        <ayah n="33"> Nor take life - which Allah has made sacred - except for just cause. And if
            anyone is slain wrongfully, we have given his heir authority (to demand qisas or to
            forgive): but let him not exceed bounds in the matter of taking life; for he is helped
            (by the Law).</ayah>
        <ayah n="34"> Come not nigh to the orphan's property except to improve it, until he attains
            the age of full strength; and fulfil (every) engagement, for (every) engagement will be
            enquired into (on the Day of Reckoning).</ayah>
        <ayah n="35"> Give full measure when ye measure, and weigh with a balance that is straight:

        <ayah n="36">
            <device type="imagery">And pursue not that of which thou hast no knowledge; for every

                the Day of Reckoning).</device></ayah>
        <ayah n="37"> Nor walk on the earth with insolence: for thou canst not rend the earth
            asunder, nor reach the mountains in height.</ayah>
        <ayah n="38"> Of all such things the evil is hateful in the sight of thy Lord.</ayah>
        <ayah n="39"> These are among the (precepts of) wisdom, which thy Lord has revealed to thee.
            Take not, with Allah, another object of worship, <device type="imagery">lest thou
                shouldst be thrown into Hell,</device> blameworthy and rejected.</ayah>
