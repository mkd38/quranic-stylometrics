        <ayah n="1">A.L.M.R. These are the signs (or verses) of the Book: that which hath been
            revealed unto thee from thy Lord is the Truth; but
            most men believe not.</ayah>
        <ayah n="2"><imagery>Allah
            is He Who raised the heavens without any pillars
            that ye can see; is firmly established on the throne (of authority); He has subjected
            the sun and the moon (to his Law)<emph>!</emph> Each one runs (its course) for a term appointed.</imagery> He
            doth regulate all affairs, explaining the signs in detail, that ye may believe with
            certainty in the meeting with your Lord.</ayah>
        <ayah n="3"><imagery>And it is He who spread out the earth, and
            set thereon mountains standing firm and (flowing) rivers: and fruit of every kind He
            made in pairs, two and two: He draweth the night as a veil o'er the Day. </imagery>Behold, <emph>verily</emph>
            in these things there are signs for those who consider<emph>!</emph></ayah>
        <ayah n="4"><imagery>And in the earth are tracts (diverse though) neighbouring, and gardens of vines
            and fields sown with corn, and palm trees - growing out of single roots or otherwise:</imagery>
            <repetition device = "anaphora">watered with the same water,</repetition> yet some of them We make more excellent than others to eat.
            Behold, <emph>verily</emph> in these things there are signs for those who understand<emph>!</emph></ayah>
        <ayah n="5">If thou dost marvel (at their want of faith), strange is their saying: "When we
            are <emph>(actually)</emph> dust, shall we <emph>indeed</emph> then be in a creation renewed?" They are those who
            deny their Lord<emph>!</emph> They are those round whose necks will be yokes (of servitude): they
            will be Companions of the Fire, to dwell therein (for aye)<emph>!</emph></ayah>
        <ayah n="6">They ask thee to hasten on the evil in preference to the good: Yet have come to
            pass, before them, (many) exemplary punishments<emph>!</emph> <repetition type="parallelism">But <emph>verily</emph>
                thy Lord is full of forgiveness for mankind for their wrong-doing, and <emph>verily</emph> thy
                Lord is (also) strict in punishment.</repetition></ayah>
        <ayah n="7">And the Unbelievers say: "Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?" But
            thou art truly a warner, and to every people a guide.</ayah>
        <ayah n="8">Allah doth know what every female (womb) doth
            bear, by how much the wombs fall short (of their time or number) or do exceed. Every
            single thing is before His sight, in (due) proportion.</ayah>
        <ayah n="9">He knoweth the unseen and that which is open: He is <amplification>the
                Great, the Most High</amplification>.</ayah>
        <ayah n="10">It is the same (to Him) whether any of you conceal his speech or declare it
            openly; <contrast>whether he lie hid by night or walk forth freely by day.</contrast></ayah>
        <ayah n="11">For each (such person) there are (angels) in succession, before and behind him:
            They guard him by command of Allah. Allah does not change a people's lot unless they change
            what is in their hearts. But when (once) Allah
            willeth a people's punishment, there can be no turning it back, nor will they find,
            besides Him, any to protect.</ayah>
        <ayah n="12"><imagery>It is He Who doth show you the lightning, by way both of fear and of hope: It
            is He Who doth raise up the clouds, heavy with (fertilising) rain<emph>!</emph></imagery></ayah>
        <ayah n="13">Nay, thunder repeateth His praises, and so do the angels, with awe: <imagery>He flingeth
            the loud-voiced thunder-bolts, and therewith He striketh whomsoever He will..</imagery>yet these
            (are the men) who (dare to) dispute about Allah, with
            the strength of His power (supreme)<emph>!</emph></ayah>
        <ayah n="14">For Him (alone) is prayer in Truth: <comparison device = "simile">any
            others that they call upon besides Him hear them no more than if they were to stretch
            forth their hands for water to reach their mouths but it reaches them not:</comparison> for the
            prayer of those without Faith is nothing but (futile) wandering (in the mind).</ayah>
        <ayah n="15">Whatever beings there are in the heavens and the earth do prostrate themselves
            to Allah (Acknowledging subjection),- with good-will
            or in spite of themselves: so do their shadows in the morning and evenings.</ayah>
        <ayah n="16">Say: "Who is the <amplification>Lord and Sustainer of the heavens and the earth</amplification>?" Say: "(It
            is) Allah." Say: "Do ye then take (for worship)
            protectors other than Him, such as have no power either for good or for harm to
            themselves?" Say: "Are the blind equal with those who see? Or the depths of darkness
            equal with light?" Or do they assign to Allah
            partners who have created (anything) as He has created, so that the creation seemed to
            them similar? Say: "Allah is the <amplification>Creator of all
            things:</amplification> He is <amplification>the One,</amplification> <amplification>the Supreme</amplification> and <amplification>Irresistible</amplification>."</ayah>
        <ayah n="17"><imagery>He sends down water from the skies, and the channels flow, each according to
            its measure: But the torrent bears away to foam that mounts up to the surface. Even so,
            from that (ore) which they heat in the fire, to make ornaments or utensils therewith,
            there is a scum likewise</imagery>. <reptetition device = "motif">Thus doth 
            Allah (by parables) show forth
            Truth and Vanity.</reptetition> <comparison type="simile">For the scum
                disappears like froth cast out; while that which is for the good of mankind
                remains on the earth.</comparison> <repetition device = "motif">Thus doth Allah set forth parables.</repetition></ayah>
        <ayah n="18">For those who respond to their Lord, are (all) good things. But those who
            respond not to Him,- Even if they had all that is in the heavens and on earth, and as
            much more, (in vain) would they offer it for ransom. For them will the reckoning be
            terrible: their abode will be Hell,- what a bed of misery<emph>!</emph></ayah>
        <ayah n="19"><rhetoricalQuestion><comparison type="simile">Is then one who doth know that that which hath been
                revealed unto thee from thy Lord is the Truth,
                like one who is blind?</comparison></rhetoricalQuestion> It is those who are endued with understanding that
            receive admonition;- </ayah>
        <ayah n="20">Those who fulfil the covenant of Allah and
            fail not in their plighted word;</ayah>
        <ayah n="21"><repetition device = "motif">Those who join together those things which
                Allah hath commanded to be joined,</repetition> hold their Lord in awe, and fear the
            terrible reckoning;</ayah>
        <ayah n="22">Those who patiently persevere, seeking the countenance of their Lord; Establish
            regular prayers; spend, out of (the gifts) We have bestowed for their sustenance,
            secretly and openly; and turn off Evil with good: for such there is the final attainment
            of the (eternal) home,-</ayah>
        <ayah n="23">Gardens of perpetual bliss: they shall enter there, as well as the righteous
            among their fathers, their spouses, and their offspring: and angels shall enter unto
            them from every gate (with the salutation):</ayah>
        <ayah n="24">"Peace unto you for that ye persevered in patience<emph>!</emph> Now how excellent is the
            final home<emph>!</emph>"</ayah>
        <ayah n="25">But those who break the Covenant of Allah,
            after having plighted their word thereto, <reptetition device = "motif">and cut asunder those things which Allah has commanded to be joined,</reptetition> and work mischief in
            the land;- on them is the curse; for them is the terrible home<emph>!</emph></ayah>
        <ayah n="26">Allah doth enlarge, or grant by (strict)
            measure, the sustenance (which He giveth) to whomso He pleaseth. (The wordly) rejoice in
            the life of this world: But the life of this world is but little comfort in the
            Hereafter.</ayah>
        <ayah n="27">The Unbelievers say: "Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?" Say:
            "<emph>Truly</emph> Allah leaveth, to stray, whom He will; But He
            guideth to Himself those who turn to Him in penitence,-</ayah>
        <ayah n="28">"Those who believe, and whose hearts find satisfaction in the remembrance of
                Allah: for without doubt in the remembrance of
                Allah do hearts find satisfaction.</ayah>
        <ayah n="29">"For those who believe and work righteousness, is (every) blessedness, and a
            beautiful place of (final) return."</ayah>
        <ayah n="30">Thus have we sent thee amongst a People before whom (long since) have (other)
            Peoples (gone and) passed away; in order that thou mightest rehearse unto them what We
            send down unto thee by inspiration; yet do they reject (Him), the <amplification>Most Gracious</amplification><emph>!</emph> Say:
            "He is my Lord<emph>!</emph> There is no god but He<emph>!</emph> On Him is my trust, and to Him do I
            turn<emph>!</emph>"</ayah>
        <ayah n="31">If there were a Qur'an with <imagery>which mountains were moved, or the earth were
            cloven asunder, or the dead were made to speak,</imagery> (this would be the one<emph>!</emph>) But, <emph>truly,</emph> the
            command is with Allah in all things<emph>!</emph> <rhetoricalQuestion>Do not the
            Believers know, that, had Allah (so) willed, He could
            have guided all mankind (to the right)?</rhetoricalQuestion> But the Unbelievers,- never will disaster cease
            to seize them for their (ill) deeds, or to settle close to their homes, until the
            promise of Allah come to pass, for, <emph>verily</emph>, Allah</device> will not fail in His promise.</ayah>
        <ayah n="32">Mocked were (many) messengers before thee: but I granted respite to the
            unbelievers, and finally I punished them: <rhetoricalQuestion>Then how (terrible) was my requital<emph>!</emph></rhetoricalQuestion></ayah>
        <ayah n="33"><rhetoricalQuestion>Is then He who standeth over every soul (and knoweth) all that it doth, (like
            any others)?</rhetoricalQuestion> And yet they ascribe partners to Allah. Say: "But name them<emph>!</emph> is it that ye will inform Him of something
                he knoweth not on earth, or is it (just) a show of words?" <emph>Nay!</emph> to those
            who believe not, their pretence seems pleasing, but they are kept back (thereby) from
            the path. And those whom Allah leaves to stray, no
            one can guide.</ayah>
        <ayah n="34"><repetition type="parallelism">Fo r them is a penalty in the life of this world, but
                harder, <emph>truly,</emph> is the penalty of the Hereafter:</repetition> and defender have they none
            against Allah.</ayah>
        <ayah n="35">The parable of the Garden which the righteous are promised<emph>!</emph>-<imagery> beneath it flow
            rivers: perpetual is the enjoyment thereof and the shade therein:<repetition device = "anaphora"> such is the end of the
            Righteous; and the end of Unbelievers in the Fire.</repetition></imagery></ayah>
        <ayah n="36">Those to whom We have given the Book rejoice at what hath been revealed unto
            thee: but there are among the clans those who reject a part thereof. Say: "I am
            commanded to worship Allah, and not to join partners
            with Him. <repetition type="anaphora">Unto Him do I call, and unto Him is my
                return.</repetition>"</ayah>
        <ayah n="37">Thus have We revealed it to be a judgment of authority in Arabic. Wert thou to
            follow their (vain) desires after the knowledge which hath reached thee, then wouldst
            thou find neither protector nor defender against
                Allah.</ayah>
        <ayah n="38">We did send messengers before thee, and appointed for them wives and children:
            and it was never the part of a messenger to bring a sign except as Allah permitted (or commanded). For each period is a Book
            (revealed).</ayah>
        <ayah n="39">Allah doth blot out or confirm what He
            pleaseth: with Him is the <allusion>Mother of the Book.</allusion></ayah>
        <ayah n="40">Whether We shall show thee (within thy life-time) part
            of what we promised them or take to ourselves thy
            soul (before it is all accomplished),- thy duty is to
            make (the Message) reach them: it is our part to call them to account.</ayah>
        <ayah n="41"><rhetoricalQuestion>See they not that We gradually reduce the land (in their control) from its
            outlying borders?</rhetoricalQuestion> <repetition type="anaphora">(Where) Allah commands, there is none to put back His Command:</repetition> and He
            is swift in calling to account.</ayah>
        <ayah n="42">Those before them did (also) devise plots; but in all things the
            master-planning is Allah's He knoweth the doings of every soul: and soon will the
            Unbelievers know who gets home in the end.</ayah>
        <ayah n="43">The Unbelievers say: "No messenger art thou." Say: "Enough for a witness
            between me and you is Allah, and such as have
            knowledge of the Book."</ayah>
