# quranic-stylometrics

## Background

The Noble Quran is the central religious text of Islam and is believed by Muslims to be the literal word of God as dictated (or “revealed”) to the Prophet Mohammed. The Quran is thought to be only holy book that exists today in the precise form and content in which it was originally produced and has consequently been preserved and documented extensively by Islamic scholars over the last ~1400 years. Arabic is the language of the Quran and thus also the liturgical language of Islam. For that reason, Muslims of all nationalities practice rote recitation of the Quran in its original Arabic. As a result of this etiology, the Quran is sometimes called “untranslateable” or inimitable, because to render it into another language would be to transform the already perfect and divine words of God. Nevertheless, the growth of Islam as a global religion has necessitated interpretations of the Quran into different languages.


## Project Proposal 
In addition to its status as a holy text, the Quran was also revered for its beautiful prose and poetry. For this project, I am interested in examining the Quran and its interpretations primarily as pieces of literature. I propose to conduct a stylometric analysis of certain selected verses from the Quran in its original Arabic and one or more English interpretations (NB: there are several) in order to compare how stylistic and rhetorical devices present in the original text are interpreted in English translations, with the goal of gaining a better understanding of what is lost in translation. 


The Quran is structured into chapters and verses, which easily lends itself to XML schemas. I will then use markup to capture rhetorical devices at play in the texts. I intend to focus on the devices of simile and metaphor, consonance and contrast, and epanalepsis, which have come to be considered the primary devices of the art of Arabic rhetoric in large part because they are featured so heavily within the text of the Quran.

#### Research Questions Defined

- What are the most common rhetorical devices used in the Arabic original text and the 
two English translations by Ali and Pickthall? How do the frequencies and distributions
of devices compare across the three texts?

A common debate in the field of translation is the struggle to balance the competing demands of style 
and faithfulness to the original text. We are interested in pinpointing the editorial choices made 
by each translator, and if there are differences in each translator's approach to the text (i.e., do one
or both translators err on the side of faithfulness to the text at the expense of style, or vice verse?) 

- What is the density of rehtorical devices within each unit of text?

English and Arabic are very disparate languages both in terms of syntactic structure and rhetorical stylings. 
Recitative poetry was a key part of Arab art and culture long before the revalation of the Qur'an, and the 
rhetorical stylings of the Qur'an, originally a text that was recited orally, continue that vibrant tradition.
We are interested in examining whether there is a significant difference in the rhetorical richness among
the three texts, as operationalized by density of devices per ayah and per surah. 

- How do English translations compensate for rhetorical elements that are available in Arabic but do not exist
in English?

One striking feature of the Arabic language is the use of the vocative particles to signify direct address and
emphatic particles to indicate topic or focus. There is no direct analog to these tools in modern English, 
so would like to examine if and how the English texts compensate for any loss of sentiment due to the lack of 
those particles.
