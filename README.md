# quranic-stylometrics

## Background

The Noble Quran is the central religious text of Islam and is believed by Muslims to be the literal word of God as dictated (or “revealed”) to the Prophet Mohammed. The Quran is thought to be only holy book that exists today in the precise form and content in which it was originally produced and has consequently been preserved and documented extensively by Islamic scholars over the last ~1400 years. Arabic is the language of the Quran and thus also the liturgical language of Islam. For that reason, Muslims of all nationalities practice rote recitation of the Quran in its original Arabic. As a result of this etiology, the Quran is sometimes called “untranslateable” or inimitable, because to render it into another language would be to transform the already perfect and divine words of God. Nevertheless, the growth of Islam as a global religion has necessitated interpretations of the Quran into different languages.


## Project Proposal 
In addition to its status as a holy text, the Quran was also revered for its beautiful prose and poetry. For this project, I am interested in examining the Quran and its interpretations primarily as pieces of literature. I propose to conduct a stylometric analysis of certain selected verses from the Quran in its original Arabic and one or more English interpretations (NB: there are several) in order to compare how stylistic and rhetorical devices present in the original text are interpreted in English translations, with the goal of gaining a better understanding of what is lost in translation. 

The Quran is structured into chapters and verses, which easily lends itself to XML schemas. I will then use markup to capture rhetorical devices at play in the texts. I intend to focus on the devices of simile and metaphor, consonance and contrast, and epanalepsis, which have come to be considered the primary devices of the art of Arabic rhetoric in large part because they are featured so heavily within the text of the Quran.
