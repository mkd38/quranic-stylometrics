            <h3> Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Overall, the differences across our three texts were not as large as we expected at the outset of the project. The differences that we did identify were often rooted in the differences between the linguistic tools available in each 
                language. There was a noticeable contrast between the Ali and Pickthall translations, with Ali making heavy use of parantheticals to suggest a particular interpretation of otherwise abiguous text. This may 
                make Ali's text more accessible to an English-speaking audience, but it also hs the effect of making the text less fluid and prose-like.</p> 
            
            <p>We also think it would be worthwhile to work out the radar plot. This would help us look at the use of rhetorical devices in the Qur'an from a different angle.</p>
            
            <p>This analysis could be made more robust with a larger, more representative sample of surahs. Ideally, the whole text would be subject to analysis, but this would be an extremely time-consuming endeavor.</p>
