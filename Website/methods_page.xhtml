            <h2>Rhetorical Devices Studied</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Amplification</h3>
            <p>
                الله or Allah is the Arabic term for "God", literally. 
                It is not a word exclusive to Muslims, as Arab Christians and Jews also refer to God as Allah. 
                In Islam, it is believed that God has many names. 
                Thus, the Qur'an often refers to God by descriptions of God's attributes. These are referred 
                to as the "99 names of God" in Islam and we decided to tag them as Amplification in our XML markup.
                Amplification is used in order to call attention to certain points; in this case, the attributes of God. 
            </p></li>
            <li><h2>Emphasis</h2>
            <p>
                While comparing the English translations to the Qur'an, we 
                noticed that the authors sometimes used words like "verily", "indeed" and "lo" as well exclamation marks "!" to emphasise certain sentences, 
                while these words were not used in Arabic in the Qur'an. Thus, we decided to tag them to see to as 
                if their usage in English translation was corelated to anything in the Qur'an. 
            </p>
            </li>
            <li><h2>Irony</h2>
            <p>
                Irony is a rhetorical device in which a statement or situation contrasts with what is expected or known,
                and is thus senstive to social contexts and norms as well as linguistic differences across languages.  
            </p></li>
            <li><h2>Imagery</h2>
            <p>
                Imagery is a literary device that uses vivid description to appeals to a readers' senses to create an image or idea in their head. 
            </p></li>

        <div class="boxed"><h3>Digital Humanities, Explained</h3>
            <p>Digital humanities is a field concerned with the use of computational tools to enhance the study of humanist disciplines.</p></div>
        
        
        <div class="boxed"><h3>Processing</h3>
        <p>The Qur'an is organized by chapters and verses, henceforth <span class="translit">surahs</span> and <span class="translit">ayahs</span>, respectively. Due to the constraints of this project, the team members selected three surahs for analysis. 
            These surahs were selected subjectively based on cultural significance and richness of the text. Our were texts sourced from the <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/">Perseus Digital Library</a>
            under Creative Commons licensing. Using XML, the texts were annotated to tag instances of eleven different stylistic devices.</p></div>
            
       <div class="boxed"><h3>Our Devices</h3>
           <ul>
               <li><span>Amplification:</span> This device refers to language which is used to glorify God. <span>Example:</span> <span class="ex">"Most Merciful, All Knowing..."</span></li>
               
               <li>Simile: "His light is like a niche in which there is a lamp, the lamp is in a crystal, the crystal is like a shining star..." Metaphor: "We have certainly cast veils over their hearts—leaving them unable to comprehend this ˹Quran˺—and deafness in their ears."</li>               
               <li>Imagery: "Let them then taste this: boiling water and ˹oozing˺ pus..."</li>
               
               <li>Repetition: (if you find instances of repetition that are not distinctly parallelism/anaphora) Parallelism: "Let the man of wealth provide according to his means. As for the one with limited resources, let him provide according to whatever Allah has given him." "They are ˹wilfully˺ deaf, dumb, and blind..." Anaphora: (could not find example in Quran) "It rained on his lousy tombstone, and it rained on the grass on his stomach. It rained all over the place."</li>
               
               <li>Allusion: "May the hands of Abu Lahab perish, and he ˹himself˺ perish!" (A symbolical reference is called allusion. Allusion is an in direct reference in a discourse by passing mention or quotation, to something generally familiar.)</li>
               
               <li>Contrast: "Those who disbelieve will have a severe punishment. But those who believe and do good will have forgiveness and a great reward."</li>
               
              <li> Irony: "Give good news of a painful punishment to hypocrites,"</li>
               
               <li>Rhetorical Question: "Is there any reward for goodness except goodness?"</li>
               
               <li>Phatic Utterance: "Lo!"</li>
           </ul>
