            <h2>Rhetorical Devices Studied</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Amplification</h3>
            <p>
                الله or Allah is the Arabic term for "God", literally. 
                It is not a word exclusive to Muslims, as Arab Christians and Jews also refer to God as Allah. 
                In Islam, it is believed that God has many names. 
                Thus, the Qur'an often refers to God by descriptions of God's attributes. These are referred 
                to as the "99 names of God" in Islam and we decided to tag them as Amplification in our XML markup.
                Amplification is used in order to call attention to certain points; in this case, the attributes of God. 
            </p></li>
            <li><h2>Emphasis</h2>
            <p>
                While comparing the English translations to the Qur'an, we 
                noticed that the authors sometimes used words like "verily", "indeed" and "lo" as well exclamation marks "!" to emphasise certain sentences, 
                while these words were not used in Arabic in the Qur'an. Thus, we decided to tag them to see to as 
                if their usage in English translation was corelated to anything in the Qur'an. 
            </p>
            </li>
            <li><h2>Irony</h2>
            <p>
                Irony is a rhetorical device in which a statement or situation contrasts with what is expected or known,
                and is thus senstive to social contexts and norms as well as linguistic differences across languages.  
            </p></li>
            <li><h2>Imagery</h2>
            <p>
                Imagery is a literary device that uses vivid description to appeals to a readers' senses to create an image or idea in their head.
