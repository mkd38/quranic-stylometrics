            <h3>Digital Humanities, Explained</h3>
            <p>Digital humanities is a field concerned with the use of computational tools to
                enhance the study of humanist disciplines.</p>

            <h3>Processing</h3>
            <p>The Qur'an is organized by chapters and verses, henceforth <span class="translit"
                    >surahs</span> and <span class="translit">ayahs</span>, respectively. Due to the
                constraints of this project, the team members selected three surahs for analysis.
                These surahs were selected subjectively based on cultural significance and richness
                of the text. Our were texts sourced from the <a
                    href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/">Perseus Digital Library</a> under
                Creative Commons licensing. Using XML, the texts were annotated to tag instances of
                eleven different stylistic devices.</p>

                        is in a crystal, the crystal is like a shining star..."</span></li>
                <li><span>Metaphor: </span>A comparison of one or more thing. <span>Example:</span>
                    <span class="ex"> "We have certainly cast veils over their hearts—leaving them
                        unable to comprehend this ˹Quran˺—and deafness in their ears."</span></li>
                <li><span>Imagery:</span> Figurative language that creates a mental image.
                        <span>Example:</span><span class="ex"> "Let them then taste this: boiling

                    <span class="ex"> "Let the man of wealth provide according to his means. As for
                        the one with limited resources, let him provide according to whatever Allah
                        has given him." "They are ˹wilfully˺ deaf, dumb, and blind..."</span></li>

                    social function, such as to start a conversation, greet someone, or say goodbye,
