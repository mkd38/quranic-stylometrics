### About the Developers

**Mary Kathleen Dryer** is a Master's student of Applied Linguistics. She completed her undergraduate degree in Linguistics and Political Science at Pitt in 2018 alongside a certificate in Arabic Language & Culture. Mary Kathleen is interested in how language shapes cultural narratives and in what our language choices reveal about our selves.

**Austin Malone** is a sophomore majoring in Urban Studies. He is a native of Tennessee. His extracurricular interests include reading, hiking, and cooking.

**Aisha Vallopra** is a senior majoring in Molecular Biology with a certificate in Community Health Assessment and minors in Chemistry and Religious Studies. She's read multiple English translations of the Qur'an and wanted to try engaging with the texts through her newly-developed computational humanities skills.

### About this Project
This project was conceived and designed to fulfil the term project requirement for the Computational Methods in Humanities, taught by Dr. David Birnbaum at the University of Pittsburgh. This project utilizes many of the tools and technologies we studied this past semester.

#### Background
The Noble Qur'an is the central religious text of Islam and is believed by Muslims to be the literal word of God as dictated as revealed to the Prophet Mohammed. The Qur'an is thought to be only holy book that exists today in the precise form and content in which it was originally produced and has consequently been preserved and documented extensively by Islamic scholars over the last 1,400 years. Arabic is the language of the Qur'an and thus also the liturgical language of Islam. For that reason, Muslims of all nationalities practice rote recitation of the Qur'an in its original Arabic. As a result of this unique etiology, the Qur'an is sometimes called “untranslateable” or inimitable, because to render it into another language would be to transform the already perfect and divine words of God. Nevertheless, the growth of Islam as a global religion has necessitated interpretations of the Quran into different languages. This project began with the question, what is lost in translation?

#### Research Questions Defined
No matter how faithful a translation claims to be, each translation must make stylistic choices that shape the translated text, often at the expense of either the original text's form or its meaning. In plainer language, in the words of Mark Baker, "Translations, like mistresses, are either ugly or faithless."
We elected to examine three texts--the Qur'an in its original Arabic, and two English language translations produced by Yusuf Ali (year?) and Mohammed Marmaduke Pickthall (year?). Because the Qur'an is a sacred text, we hypothesized at the outset of this project that we would see significant differences in the stylistic elements used in the three texts because we reasoned that the translators would prioritize fidelity of meaning over mimicing the style of the original text.

 - What are the most common rhetorical devices used in the Arabic original text and the two English translations by Ali and Pickthall? How do the frequencies and distributions of devices compare across the three texts?
    
    We are interested in pinpointing the editorial choices made by each translator, and if there are differences in each translator's approach to the text (that is, do one or both translators err on the side of faithfulness to the text at the expense of style, or vice verse?).
    
-  What is the density of rehtorical devices within each unit of text?

    English and Arabic are very different languages both in terms of syntactic structure and rhetorical stylings. Recitative poetry was a key part of Arab art and culture long before the revalation of the Qur'an, and the rhetorical stylings of the Qur'an (originally a text that was recited orally) continue that vibrant tradition. We are interested in examining whether there is a significant difference in the rhetorical richness among the three texts, as operationalized by density of devices per ayah and per surah.
 
 - Do the English translations compensate for rhetorical elements that are available in Arabic but do not exist in English?

    One striking feature of the Arabic language is the use of the vocative particles to signify direct address and emphatic particles to indicate topic or focus. There is no direct analog to these tools in modern English, so would like to examine if and how the English texts compensate for any loss of sentiment due to the lack of those particles.
