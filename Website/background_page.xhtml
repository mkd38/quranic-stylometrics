                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>The Qur'an is the central religious text of Islam and is believed by Muslims to
                    be the literal word of God as dictated as revealed to the Prophet Mohammed. The
                    Qur'an is thought to be the only holy book that exists today in the precise form
                    and content in which it was originally produced and has consequently been
                    preserved and documented extensively by Islamic scholars over the last 1,400
                    years. Arabic is the language of the Qur'an and thus also the liturgical
                    language of Islam. For that reason, Muslims of all nationalities practice rote
                    recitation of the Qur'an in its original Arabic. As a result of this unique
                    etiology, the Qur'an is sometimes called “untranslateable” or inimitable,
                    because to render it into another language would be to transform the already
                    perfect and divine words of God. Nevertheless, the growth of Islam as a global
                    religion with over <span>1.9 billion adherents </span> has necessitated
                    interpretations of the Qur'an into different languages. This project began with
                    the question, what is lost in translation?</p>

            <h3>Our Texts</h3>
            <p><span>The Noble Qur'an:</span> The name of this text is derived from the Arabic word
                for "recitation," which references the rich oral history of this text. The Qur'an is
                estimated by religious scholars to have been revealed beginning in 610 - 632 CE. The
                text was collected and canonized under the caliphate of Rashidun Uthman, around 650
                CE.</p>

            <p><span>The Holy Qur'an, trans. Yusuf Ali:</span>
                <span class="author ali"><img

                        alt="Abdullah Yusuf Ali" />Abdullah Yusuf Ali</span> (1872–1953) was an
                Indian Islamic scholar. His translation of the Qur'an was published in 1938 and
                remains one of the most widely-known and used translation in the English-speaking
                world.</p>

            <p><span>The Glorious Qur'an, trans. Pickthall:</span>
                <span class="author pickthall"><img

                        alt="Muhammed Marmaduke Pickthall" />Muhammed Marmaduke Pickthall</span>
                (1875 – 1936) was an English-born novelist and scholar of the Islamic World who
                converted to Islam in 1917. Pickthall was a novelist and a contemporary of writers
                like D.H. Lawrence, H.G. Well, and E.M. Forster, but he is perhaps best known The
                Meaning of the Glorious Koran, an English language translation of the holy text with
                exegis.</p>
