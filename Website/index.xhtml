                    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
                    <p>The Qur'an is the primary holy text of Islam. It is famous in part due to its
                        beautiful prose and poetry. This project presents a cross-linguistic
                        analysis of certain selected verses from the Qur'an in its original Arabic
                        and its two most famous English interpretations. Using the tools and
                        techniques of digital humanities, we investigate how stylistic and
                        rhetorical devices present in the original text are interpreted in the
                        English translations, with the goal of gaining a better understanding of how
                        a text is transformed when it undergoes translation.</p>

                    <h3> About this Project</h3>
                    <p>This project was conceived and designed to fulfil the requirements of the
                        course "Computational Methods in Humanities," taught by Dr. David Birnbaum
                        at the University of Pittsburgh. This project utilizes many of the tools and
                        technologies we studied this past semester.</p>

                    <h3>About the Developers</h3>
                    <p><span>Mary Kathleen Dryer</span> is a Master's student of Applied
                        Linguistics. She completed her undergraduate degree in Linguistics and

                        &amp; Culture. Mary Kathleen is interested in how language shapes cultural
                        narratives and in what our language choices reveal about our selves.</p>
                    <p><span>Austin Malone</span> is a sophomore majoring in Urban Studies. He is a
                        native of Tennessee. His extracurricular interests include reading, hiking,
                        and cooking. Austin has a particular interest in world religions.</p>

                        certificate in Community Health Assessment and minors in Chemistry and
                        Religious Studies. She's read multiple English translations of the Qur'an
                        and wanted to try engaging with the texts through her newly-developed
                        computational humanities skills.</p>
                    <p>The developers would like to extend our thanks to <span>Renee Dubaich</span>,
                        our project mentor, for her thoughtful guidance and feedback, as well as
