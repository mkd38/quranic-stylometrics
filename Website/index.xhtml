                    <p>This site presents a cross-linguistic analysis of Qur'anic poetics using the
                        tools and techniques of digital humanities. The goal of this site and
                        project were to answer the following questions: What are the most common
                        rhetorical devices used in the Arabic original text and the two English
                        translations by Ali and Pickthall? How do the frequencies and distributions
                        of devices compare across the three texts?</p>

                    <p>This project was conceived and designed to fulfil the term project
                        requirement for the course titled Computational Methods in Humanities,
                        taught by Dr. David Birnbaum at the University of Pittsburgh. This project
                        utilizes many of the tools and technologies we studied this past
                        semester.</p>
