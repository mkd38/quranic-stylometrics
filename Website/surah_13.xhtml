      <main>
         <div>(1) </div>
         <div>(1) A.L.M.R. These are the signs (or verses) of the Book: that which hath been
            revealed unto thee from thy Lord is the Truth; but
            most men believe not.</div>
         <div>(1)  Alif. Lam. Mim. Ra. These are verses of the Scripture. That which is revealed
            unto thee from thy Lord is the Truth, but most of mankind believe not. </div>
         <div>(2) </div>
         <div>(2) Allah is He Who raised the heavens
            without any pillars that ye can see; is firmly established on the throne (of authority);
            He has subjected the sun and the moon (to his Law)! Each one runs (its
            course) for a term appointed. He doth regulate all affairs, explaining the signs in
            detail, that ye may believe with certainty in the meeting with your Lord.</div>
         <div>(2)  Allah it is Who raised up the heavens without visible supports, then mounted
            the Throne, and compelled the sun and the moon to be of service, each runneth
            unto an appointed term ; He ordereth the course; He detaileth the
            revelations, that haply ye may be certain of the meeting with your Lord. </div>
         <div>(3) </div>
         <div>(3) And it is He who spread out
            the earth, and set thereon mountains standing firm and (flowing) rivers: and fruit
            of every kind He made in pairs, two and two: He draweth the night as a veil o'er the
            Day. Behold, verily in these things there are signs for those
            who consider!</div>
         <div>(3)  And He it is Who spread out the earth and placed therein firm hills
            and flowing streams, and of all fruits He placed therein two spouses (male and
            female). He covereth the night with the day. Lo! herein
            verily are portents for people who take thought. </div>
         <div>(4) </div>
         <div>(4) And in the earth are tracts (diverse though) neighbouring, and gardens
            of vines and fields sown with corn, and palm trees - growing out of single roots or
            otherwise: watered with the same water, yet some of them We make more
            excellent than others to eat. Behold, verily in these things there are
            signs for those who understand!</div>
         <div>(4)  And in the Earth are neighbouring tracts, vineyards and ploughed
            lands, and date-palms, like and unlike, which are watered with one water. And we have
            made some of them to
            excel others in fruit. Lo! herein verily are portents for
            people who have sense. </div>
         <div>(5) </div>
         <div>(5) If thou dost marvel (at their want of faith), strange is their saying: "When we
            are (actually) dust, shall we indeed then be in a creation renewed?" They
            are those who deny their Lord! They are those round whose necks will be
            yokes (of servitude): they will be Companions of the Fire, to dwell therein (for
            aye)!</div>
         <div>(5) 
            And if thou wonderest, then wondrous is their
            saying: When we are dust, are
            we then forsooth (to be raised) in a new creation? Such are they who disbelieve in
            their
            Lord; such have carcans on their necks; such are rightful owners of
            the Fire, they will abide therein. </div>
         <div>(6) </div>
         <div>(6) They ask thee to hasten on the evil in preference to the good: Yet have come to
            pass, before them, (many) exemplary punishments!
            But verily thy Lord is full of forgiveness
            for mankind for their wrong-doing, and verily thy Lord is (also) strict
            in punishment.</div>
         <div>(6)  And they bid thee hasten on the evil rather than the good, when exemplary
            punishments have indeed occurred before them. But lo!
            thy Lord is rich in pardon for mankind despite their
            wrong, and lo! thy Lord is strong in punishment.
            </div>
         <div>(7) </div>
         <div>(7) And the Unbelievers say: "Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?" But
            thou art truly a warner, and to every people a guide.</div>
         <div>(7)  Those who disbelieve say: If only some portent were sent down upon him from his
            Lord! Thou art a warner only, and for every folk a guide. </div>
         <div>(8) </div>
         <div>(8) Allah doth know what every female (womb) doth bear, by how much the wombs fall
            short (of their time or nber) or do exceed. Every single thing is before His sight,
            in
            (due) proportion.</div>
         <div>(8)  Allah knoweth that which every female beareth and that which the wombs absorb
            and that which they grow. And everything with Him is measured. </div>
         <div>(9) </div>
         <div>(9) He knoweth the unseen and that which is open: He is the
            Great, the Most High.</div>
         <div>(9)  He is the Knower of the Invisible and the
            Visible, the Great,
            the High Exalted. </div>
         <div>(10) </div>
         <div>(10) It is the same (to Him) whether any of you conceal his speech or declare it
            openly; whether he lie hid by night or walk forth freely by day.</div>
         <div>(10) 
            Alike of you is he who hideth the saying and he who
            noiseth it abroad, he who lurketh in the
            night and he who goeth freely in the daytime.
            </div>
         <div>(11) </div>
         <div>(11) For each (such person) there are (angels) in succession, before and behind him:
            They guard him by command of Allah. Allah does not change a people's lot unless they
            change what is in their hearts. But when (once) Allah willeth a people's punishment,
            there can be no turning it back, nor will they find, besides Him, any to protect.</div>
         <div>(11)  For him are angels ranged before him and behind him, who guard him by Allah's
            command. Lo! Allah changeth not the condition of a folk until they (first)
            change that which is in their hearts; and if Allah willeth misfortune for a folk there
            is none that can repel it, nor have they a defender beside Him. </div>
         <div>(12) </div>
         <div>(12) It is He Who doth show you the
            lightning, by way both of fear and of hope: It is He Who
            doth raise up the clouds, heavy with (fertilising)
            rain!</div>
         <div>(12)  He it is Who showeth you the lightning, a fear and a hope, and
            raiseth the heavy clouds.
            </div>
         <div>(13) </div>
         <div>(13) Nay, thunder repeateth His praises, and so do the angels, with awe: He
            flingeth the loud-voiced thunder-bolts, and therewith He striketh
            whomsoever He will..yet these (are the men) who (dare to) dispute about Allah, with
            the
            strength of His power (supreme)!</div>
         <div>(13)  The thunder hymneth His praise and (so do) the angels for awe of Him.
            He launcheth the thunderbolts and smiteth with them whom He will
            while they dispute (in doubt) concerning Allah, and He is mighty in wrath. </div>
         <div>(14) </div>
         <div>(14) For Him (alone) is prayer in Truth:
            any others that they call upon besides Him hear them no more than if they
            were to stretch forth their hands for water to reach their mouths but it reaches
            them not: for the prayer of those without Faith is nothing but (futile)
            wandering (in the mind).</div>
         <div>(14)  Unto Him is the real prayer. Those unto whom they pray beside Allah respond to
            them not at all, save as (is the response to) one who
            stretcheth forth his hands toward water (asking) that it may come unto his mouth,
            and it will never reach it. The prayer of disbelievers goeth (far)
            astray. </div>
         <div>(15) </div>
         <div>(15) Whatever beings there are in the heavens and the earth do prostrate themselves
            to Allah (Acknowledging subjection),- with good-will or in spite of themselves: so
            do
            their shadows in the morning and evenings.</div>
         <div>(15)  And unto Allah falleth prostrate whosoever is in the heavens and the earth,
            willingly or unwillingly, as do their shadows in the morning and the evening hours.
            </div>
         <div>(16) </div>
         <div>(16) Say: "Who is the Lord and Sustainer of the heavens and the
            earth?" Say: "(It is) Allah." Say: "Do ye then take (for worship)
            protectors other than Him, such as have no power either for good or for harm to
            themselves?" Say: "Are the blind equal with those who
            see?
            Or the depths of darkness equal with light?"
            Or do they assign to Allah partners who have created (anything) as
            He has created, so that the creation seemed to them similar?
            Say: "Allah is the Creator of all things: He is
            the One, the Supreme and
            Irresistible."</div>
         <div>(16)  Say (O
            Muhammad): Who is Lord of the heavens and the
            earth? Say: Allah. Say: Take ye then (others) beside Him for
            protectors, which, even for themselves, have neither benefit nor hurt? Say: Is the
            blind
            man equal to the seer, or is darkness equal to light? Or assign they unto Allah partners
            who created the like of His creation so that the creation (which they made and His
            creation) seemed alike to them? Say: Allah is the Creator of all
            things, and He is the One,
            the Almighty. </div>
         <div>(17) </div>
         <div>(17) He sends down water from the skies, and the channels flow, each
            according to its measure: But the torrent bears away to foam that mounts up to the
            surface. Even so, from that (ore) which they heat in the fire, to make
            ornaments or utensils therewith, there is a scum likewise. Thus doth Allah (by parables)
            show forth Truth and Vanity. For the scum disappears like forth cast out; while that
            which is for the good of mankind remains on the earth. Thus doth Allah set forth
            parables.</div>
         <div>(17) 
            He sendeth down water from the sky, so that valleys flow according to their
            measure, and the flood beareth (on its surface) swelling foam - from that which they
            smelt in the fire in order to make ornaments and tools riseth a foam like unto it
            - thus Allah coineth (the similitude of) the true and the false. Then, as for
            the foam, it passeth away as scum upon the
            banks, while, as for that which is of use to mankind, it remaineth in
            the earth. Thus Allah coineth the similitudes. </div>
         <div>(18) </div>
         <div>(18) For those who respond to their Lord, are (all) good things. But those who
            respond not to Him,- Even if they had all that is in the heavens and on earth, and
            as
            much more, (in vain) would they offer it for ransom. For them will the reckoning be
            terrible: their abode will be Hell,- what a bed of misery!</div>
         <div>(18)  For those who answered Allah's call is bliss; and for those who answered not
            His call, if they had all that is in the earth, and therewith the like thereof, they
            would proffer it as ransom. Such will have a woeful reckoning, and their habitation
            will
            be hell, a dire abode. </div>
         <div>(19) </div>
         <div>(19) Is then one who doth know that that which hath been
            revealed unto thee from thy Lord is the Truth,
            like one who is blind? It is those who are endued with understanding
            that receive admonition;- </div>
         <div>(19) 
            Is he who knoweth that what is revealed
            unto thee from thy Lord is the truth like him who is
            blind? But only men of understanding heed; </div>
         <div>(20) </div>
         <div>(20) Those who fulfil the covenant of Allah and fail not in their plighted
            word;</div>
         <div>(20)  Such as keep the pact of Allah, and break not the covenant; </div>
         <div>(21) </div>
         <div>(21) Those who join together those things which Allah hath commanded to be joined,
            hold their Lord in awe, and fear the terrible reckoning;</div>
         <div>(21)  Such as unite that which Allah hath commandeth
            should be joined, and fear their Lord, and dread a woeful reckoning; </div>
         <div>(22) </div>
         <div>(22) Those who patiently persevere, seeking the countenance of their Lord; Establish
            regular prayers; spend, out of (the gifts) We have bestowed for their sustenance,
            secretly and openly; and turn off Evil with good: for such there is the final attainment
            of the (eternal) home,-</div>
         <div>(22)  Such as persevere in seeking their Lord's Countenance and are regular in
            prayer and spend of that which We bestow upon them secretly and openly, and overcome
            evil with good. Theirs will be the sequel of the (heavenly) Home, </div>
         <div>(23) </div>
         <div>(23) Gardens of perpetual bliss: they shall enter there, as well as the righteous
            among their fathers, their spouses, and their offspring: and angels shall enter unto
            them from every gate (with the salutation):</div>
         <div>(23)  Gardens of Eden which they enter, along with all who do right of their fathers
            and their helpmeets and their seed. The angels enter unto them from every gate, </div>
         <div>(24) </div>
         <div>(24) "Peace unto you for that ye persevered in patience! Now how
            excellent is the final home!"</div>
         <div>(24)  (Saying): Peace be unto you because ye persevered. Ah, passing sweet will be
            the sequel of the (heavenly) Home. </div>
         <div>(25) </div>
         <div>(25) But those who break the Covenant of Allah, after having plighted their word
            thereto, and cut asunder those things which Allah has commanded to be joined, and
            work
            mischief in the land;- on them is the curse; for them is the terrible
            home!</div>
         <div>(25)  And those who break the covenant of Allah after ratifying it, and sever that which
            Allah hath commanded should be joined,
            and make mischief in the earth: theirs is the curse and theirs the ill abode. </div>
         <div>(26) </div>
         <div>(26) Allah doth enlarge, or grant by (strict) measure, the sustenance (which He
            giveth) to whomso He pleaseth. (The wordly) rejoice in the life of this world: But
            the
            life of this world is but little comfort in the Hereafter.</div>
         <div>(26)  Allah enlargeth livelihood for whom He will, and straiteneth (it for whom He
            will); and they rejoice in the life of the world, whereas the life of the world is
            but
            brief comfort as compared with the Hereafter. </div>
         <div>(27) </div>
         <div>(27) The Unbelievers say: "Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?" Say:
            "Truly Allah leaveth, to stray, whom He will; But He guideth to Himself those who
            turn
            to Him in penitence,-</div>
         <div>(27)  Those who disbelieve say: If only a portent were sent down upon him from his
            Lord! Say: Lo! Allah sendeth whom He will astray, and
            guideth unto Himself all who turn (unto Him), </div>
         <div>(28) </div>
         <div>(28) Those who believe, and whose hearts find
            satisfaction in the remembrance of Allah: for without doubt in the remembrance of
            Allah do hearts find satisfaction.</div>
         <div>(28)  Who have believed and whose hearts have rest in the remembrance of Allah.
            Verily in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest! </div>
         <div>(29) </div>
         <div>(29) "For those who believe and work righteousness, is (every) blessedness, and a
            beautiful place of (final) return."</div>
         <div>(29)  Those who believe and do right: Joy is for them, and bliss (their) journey's
            end. </div>
         <div>(30) </div>
         <div>(30) Thus have we sent thee amongst a People before whom (long since) have (other)
            Peoples (gone and) passed away; in order that thou mightest rehearse unto them what
            We
            send down unto thee by inspiration; yet do they reject (Him), the Most
            Gracious! Say: "He is my Lord! There is no
            god but He! On Him is my trust, and to Him do I turn!"</div>
         <div>(30)  Thus We send thee (O
            Muhammad) unto a nation, before whom other nations have passed away, that
            thou mayst recite unto them that which We have inspired in thee, while they are
            disbelievers in the Beneficent. Say: He is my Lord; there is no Allah save Him. In
            Him
            do I put my trust and unto Him is my recourse. </div>
         <div>(31) </div>
         <div>(31) If there were a Qur'an with which mountains were moved, or the earth were
            cloven asunder, or the dead were made to speak, (this would be the one!)
            But, truly, the command is with Allah in all things! Do not the Believers
            know, that, had Allah (so) willed, He could have guided all mankind (to the right)?
            But
            the Unbelievers,- never will disaster cease to seize them for their (ill) deeds, or
            to
            settle close to their homes, until the promise of Allah come to pass, for,
            verily, Allah will not fail in His promise.</div>
         <div>(31)  Had it been possible for a Lecture to cause the mountains to move, or
            the earth to be torn asunder, or the dead to speak, (this Qur'an would
            have done so). Nay, but Allah's is the whole command. Do not those
            who believe know that, had Allah willed, He could have guided all
            mankind? As for those who disbelieve, disaster ceaseth not to
            strike them because of what they do, or it dwelleth near their home until the threat
            of
            Allah come to pass. Lo! Allah faileth not to keep the tryst. </div>
         <div>(32) </div>
         <div>(32) Mocked were (many) messengers before thee: but I granted respite to the
            unbelievers, and finally I punished them: Then how (terrible) was my
            requital!</div>
         <div>(32)  And verily messengers (of Allah) were mocked before thee, but
            long I bore with those who disbelieved. At length I seized them, and
            how (awful) was My punishment!
            </div>
         <div>(33) </div>
         <div>(33) Is then He who standeth over every soul (and knoweth) all that it doth, (like
            any others)? And yet they ascribe partners to Allah. Say:
            "But name them! is it that ye will inform Him of
            something he knoweth not on earth, or is it (just) a show of
            words?"
            Nay! to those who believe not, their pretence seems pleasing, but they are
            kept back (thereby) from the path. And those whom Allah leaves to stray, no one can
            guide.</div>
         <div>(33) 
            Is He Who is aware of the deserts of every soul (as he who is aware
            of nothing)? Yet they ascribe unto Allah partners. Say: Name
            them. Is it that ye would inform Him of something which He knoweth not in the earth?
            Or
            is it but a way of speaking? Nay but their contrivance is made seeming fair for those
            who disbelieve and they are kept from the right road. He whom Allah sendeth astray,
            for
            him there is no guide. </div>
         <div>(34) </div>
         <div>(34) For them is a penalty in the life of this world,
            but harder, truly, is the penalty of the Hereafter: and defender have
            they none against Allah.</div>
         <div>(34)  For them is torment in the life of the world, and verily the doom
            of the Hereafter is more painful, and they have no defender from Allah. </div>
         <div>(35) </div>
         <div>(35) The parable of the Garden which the righteous are promised!-
            beneath it flow rivers: perpetual is the enjoyment thereof and the shade therein:
            such
            is the end of the Righteous; and the end of Unbelievers in the Fire.</div>
         <div>(35)  A similitude of the Garden which is promised unto those who keep their duty
            (to Allah): Underneath it rivers flow; its food is everlasting, and its
            shade; this is the reward of those who
            keep their duty, while the reward of disbelievers is the Fire.
            </div>
         <div>(36) </div>
         <div>(36) Those to whom We have given the Book rejoice at what hath been revealed unto
            thee: but there are among the clans those who reject a part thereof. Say: "I am
            commanded to worship Allah, and not to join partners with Him. Unto Him do I call,
            and unto Him is my
            return."</div>
         <div>(36)  Those unto whom We gave the Scripture rejoice in that which is revealed unto
            thee. And of the clans there are who deny some of it. Say: I am commanded only that
            I
            serve Allah and ascribe unto Him no partner. Unto Him I
            cry, and unto Him is my return.
            </div>
         <div>(37) </div>
         <div>(37) Thus have We revealed it to be a judgment of authority in Arabic. Wert thou to
            follow their (vain) desires after the knowledge which hath reached thee, then wouldst
            thou find neither protector nor defender against Allah.</div>
         <div>(37)  Thus have We revealed it, a decisive utterance in Arabic; and if thou shouldst
            follow their desires after that which hath come unto thee of knowledge, then truly
            wouldst thou have from Allah no protecting friend nor defender. </div>
         <div>(38) </div>
         <div>(38) We did send messengers before thee, and appointed for them wives and children:
            and it was never the part of a messenger to bring a sign except as Allah permitted
            (or
            commanded). For each period is a Book (revealed).</div>
         <div>(38)  And verily We sent messengers (to mankind) before thee, and We
            appointed for them wives and offspring, and it was not (given) to any messenger that
            he
            should bring a portent save by Allah's leave. For everything there is a time prescribed.
            </div>
         <div>(39) </div>
         <div>(39) Allah doth blot out or confirm what He pleaseth: with Him is the Mother of the
            Book.</div>
         <div>(39) 
            Allah effaceth what He will, and establisheth (what He
            will), and with Him is the source of ordinance. </div>
         <div>(40) </div>
         <div>(40) Whether We shall show thee (within thy life-time) part of what we promised them
            or take to ourselves thy soul (before it is all accomplished),- thy duty is to make
            (the
            Message) reach them: it is our part to call them to account.</div>
         <div>(40)  Whether We let thee see something of that which We have promised them, or make
            thee die (before its happening), thine is but conveyance (of the message). Ours the
            reckoning. </div>
         <div>(41) </div>
         <div>(41) See they not that We gradually reduce the land (in their control) from its
            outlying borders? (Where) Allah commands, there is none
            to put back His Command: and He is swift in calling to account.</div>
         <div>(41) 
            See they not how we aim to the land, reducing it of its outlying
            parts? (When) Allah doometh there
            is none that can postpone His doom, and He is swift at reckoning. </div>
         <div>(42) </div>
         <div>(42) Those before them did (also) devise plots; but in all things the
            master-planning is Allah's He knoweth the doings of every soul: and soon will the
            Unbelievers know who gets home in the end.</div>
         <div>(42) 
            Those who were before them plotted; but all plotting is
            Allah's. He knoweth that which each soul earneth. The disbelievers will
            come to know for whom will be the sequel of the (heavenly) Home. </div>
         <div>(43) </div>
         <div>(43) The Unbelievers say: "No messenger art thou." Say: "Enough for a witness
            between me and you is Allah, and such as have knowledge of the Book."</div>
         <div>(43)  They who disbelieve say: Thou art no messenger (of Allah). Say: Allah, and
            whosoever hath knowledge of the Scripture, is sufficient witness between me and you.
